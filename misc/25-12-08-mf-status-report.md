---

## 1. Chronic Conditions and Surgical History

### 1.1 Ulcerative Colitis and Abdominal Surgery

* Longstanding **ulcerative colitis**.
* Prior **total proctocolectomy with J‑pouch and end ileostomy** (remote).
* Major surgeries in **May–August 2019** (Colorectal Surgery, Dr. Smithy):

  * **05/05/2019:** Exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, reduction of closed‑loop obstruction/internal hernia, small‑bowel resection.
  * **05/13/2019:** Re‑laparotomy with **two additional small‑bowel resections**, creation of **end ileostomy** and **mucous fistula**.
  * **08/2019:** Incisional wound debridement and drainage; complicated by wound infection and subsequent development of multiple **enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs)** along prior midline incision.

**Resulting chronic issues:**

* **Short‑gut syndrome** with **functional short intestine**.
* **Chronic high‑output ileostomy**.
* Multiple **enterocutaneous fistulas** along prior midline incision.
* Frequent **SBO‑like episodes**, though imaging often shows chronic small‑bowel dilation rather than clear mechanical obstruction.
* Current abdominal findings:

  * **End ileostomy midline**, productive of liquid stool and gas.
  * Multiple ECFs, with intermittent bleeding from one superior fistula.

### 1.2 Short‑Gut Syndrome and Nutrition

* Functionally **short intestine** leading to chronic malabsorption.
* **TPN‑dependent**:

  * TPN **3 days/week**.
  * **2 L IV fluids** on non‑TPN days.
* Chronic use of **teduglutide (Gattex)** to augment intestinal absorption.
* Oral intake is limited; she can generally eat, but cannot meet caloric/protein needs enterally.

### 1.3 Central Venous Access, Line History, and IVC Filter

* **Long history of central venous catheters** for TPN:

  * Multiple tunneled lines (ports, Hickmans via LIJ and RIJ) since 2019.
* **3/2025:** Left IJ Hickman placed for TPN; complicated by **CLABSI** with:

  * **Caballeronia jiangsuensis** and **methicillin‑resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)**.
  * Treated with **meropenem + daptomycin for 2 weeks**.

#### IVC Filter

* **Suprarenal IVC filter** placed in **2009**.
* **Failed removal attempt**; earlier notes describe it as “dislodged IVC filter.”
* Imaging (e.g. **RUQ US 10/29/2025**, **CT A/P 10/26/2025** and subsequent scans):

  * Show persistent **suprarenal IVC filter**.
  * **Hyper‑echogenic/hyperdense material** in/around the filter consistent with thrombus or filter struts.
* Vascular surgery previously involved; outpatient follow‑up recommended.
* Later CT venogram (12/6) notes the filter is **tilted** with **multiple struts extending beyond the IVC** and suggests IR consult for retrieval if appropriate.

### 1.4 Other Chronic Conditions

* **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** – documented as non‑obstructive.
* **Hypertension**, usually treated with **losartan** (held at times for AKI or hyperkalemia).
* **Asthma** (no acute exacerbation in current records).
* **Obesity** historically; current BMI ~20.5 after chronic illness–related weight loss.
* History of:

  * **Frequent hospital admissions**.
  * **Falls**.
  * **Coagulopathy/anemia** (multifactorial: chronic disease, bleeding, etc.).

## 2. Infectious and Line‑Related Events in 2025 (Pre‑current Admission)

### 2.1 October 2025 Admission (10/28–11/4/2025; FIN 010249711069)

**Initial presentation (10/26 ED):**

* **E. coli cystitis/pyelonephritis**:

  * Symptoms: dysuria, suprapubic and flank pain.
  * **CT A/P 10/26:** cystitis; **CBD stones**, cholelithiasis with hydropic gallbladder, mild CBD dilation; suprarenal IVC filter with hyperdense material.
  * Treated with **oral cefpodoxime**.

Shortly after:

* Outpatient blood cultures from 10/26 grew **methicillin‑resistant Staphylococcus hominis** (2/2 bottles).

**Hospital course (10/28–11/4):**

* Admitted 10/28/2025 with **Staph hominis bacteremia**, presumed **line‑related** to the left IJ Hickman (placed 3/2025; debris around insertion site noted).
* Antibiotics:

  * Started on **linezolid**, then transitioned to **daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV daily** for Staph hominis.
  * Continued **ceftriaxone** for UTI.
* **RUQ ultrasound 10/29/2025:**

  * **Cholelithiasis with hydropic gallbladder**, mild wall thickening, but no clear acute cholecystitis.
  * Mild intra‑ and extrahepatic bile duct dilation; suspect sludge/stone in the CBD.
  * Mild hepatomegaly with increased echogenicity (consistent with steatosis/fibrosis).
  * **Suprarenal IVC filter with echogenic material** suggesting thrombus or struts.
* **10/30/2025:** Left IJ **Hickman exchange over wire** – successful.
* Blood cultures ultimately cleared.

**Discharge 11/4/2025:**

* Diagnoses:

  * **Staph hominis bacteremia (line‑related)**.
  * **E. coli pyelonephritis**.
  * **Short‑gut syndrome on TPN**.
  * **Cholelithiasis**.
  * **IVC filter with possible thrombus**.
* Discharge antibiotics:

  * Continued **IV daptomycin** at home via the new left IJ Hickman.
* Follow‑up:

  * **Infectious Disease**.
  * **Vascular Surgery** (IVC filter).
  * PCP for BP and hyperkalemia monitoring (losartan initially held).

### 2.2 November 5–12, 2025 Admission (FIN 010250121976)

**Trigger for readmission (11/5):**

* After discharge on 11/4, she infused TPN that evening through the **new left IJ Hickman** and developed:

  * **Chills, rigors, 101°F fever**, which resolved when TPN was stopped.
* On 11/5 she took her scheduled **daptomycin**, then presented to the ED with recurrent chills/rigors.
* Left IJ Hickman was **removed in the ED**.

**Initial findings:**

* WBC **26K** (92% neutrophils).
* Systolic BP in the **90s** (soft).
* CXR: left dual‑lumen catheter at cavoatrial junction.
* Concern for **recurrent line infection** (Staph hominis) vs new CLABSI.

**Microbiology and ID management:**

* 11/5 blood cultures grew **Stenotrophomonas maltophilia** (line‑associated).
* Antibiotic changes:

  * Initially **cefepime + daptomycin**.
  * Then **cefiderocol 2 g q8h IV + daptomycin**, per ID.
* Echocardiogram: no vegetations reported.
* Surveillance blood cultures became negative.

**New line:**

* **11/11/2025:** New **right IJ Hickman** placed (12 Fr x 19 cm) via IR, with fluoroscopic confirmation, no immediate complications.

**Discharge 11/12/2025:**

* Diagnoses:

  * Recurrent **Staph hominis bacteremia**.
  * **Stenotrophomonas maltophilia** line infection.
  * Short‑gut syndrome on TPN.
  * Non‑obstructive CAD.
  * UC with ileostomy.
  * IVC filter.
* Final ID regimen:

  * **Oral Bactrim DS 2 tablets q8h** + **oral minocycline 200 mg q12h**.
  * Planned **14‑day total** course for Stenotrophomonas, ending **11/24/2025**.
* TPN via new **right IJ Hickman** continued.
* Close outpatient ID and PCP follow‑up planned.

In practice, she developed severe nausea, vomiting, and high‑output ostomy on this high‑dose oral regimen and was readmitted **11/16/2025** unable to continue it. During the subsequent admission, Infectious Disease restarted **IV cefiderocol + IV minocycline** and defined a new **14‑day inpatient course for Stenotrophomonas from 11/16 through 11/29/2025**.

---

## 3. Current Admission (11/16/2025 – Present)

### 3.1 Reason for Admission and Initial Presentation

**Admitted 11/16/2025** with:

* **Chief complaints:**

  * Severe **nausea and vomiting**.
  * Inability to tolerate **oral Bactrim and minocycline**.
  * **Increased watery/foamy ileostomy output**.

**Context:**

* She was on **high‑dose Bactrim DS + minocycline** from the prior admission for Stenotrophomonas.
* Symptoms began soon after discharge:

  * Persistent, severe nausea.
  * Frequent vomiting and dry heaving.
  * Increased green, watery ostomy output, still with gas.
  * Fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, diaphoresis.
  * No high fevers or chills reported at admission.

**Initial labs 11/16:**

* WBC ~**11–12 K**.
* **AKI:** Creatinine **1.26** (baseline ~0.6), BUN **45**.
* **Hyponatremia:** Na **131**.
* **Lactic acidosis:** lactate **4.5 → 1.7** after fluids.
* Hgb **15.5** (hemoconcentrated).
* Platelets ~**250K**.

**Initial imaging (11/16):**

* **CT Abdomen/Pelvis (non‑contrast):**

  * Findings “concerning for **small bowel obstruction**” with suspected transition point at anterior central lower abdomen.
  * Persistent **CBD dilation** with ~1.0 cm density suggesting choledocholithiasis or biliary sludge.
  * Distended gallbladder with multiple stones and mild sludge; no definitive acute cholecystitis.
* **CT Chest (same date):**

  * Essentially mirrored abdominal CT impressions re SBO and biliary pathology.

### 3.2 Early Consults and Inpatient Management

**Infectious Disease consult (11/16):**

* Reviewed history of **line‑related Stenotrophomonas maltophilia** and recurrent line infections.
* Recognized **failure of PO Bactrim ± levofloxacin** due to severe GI intolerance.
* ID recommendations:

  * **Stop IV Bactrim** due to AKI.
  * Start **IV cefiderocol 1.5 g q8h** + **IV minocycline 200 mg q12h** for Stenotrophomonas.
  * Obtain CT A/P (done).
  * Send **GI PCR stool panel** (C. diff initially deferred).
  * Repeat **blood cultures** from line and periphery.

**Colorectal Surgery (CRS) consult (11/17 & 11/18):**

* Recognized her as a complex prior surgical patient with **chronically dilated small bowel**.
* Clinical exam:

  * Ileostomy with copious liquid stool and gas.
  * Soft, non‑distended abdomen, mild RLQ tenderness.
* Impression:

  * No clear **mechanical SBO** clinically; CT dilatation likely chronic.
  * Nausea more likely from **medications and/or biliary disease**.
* Recommendations:

  * No acute surgical intervention for bowel.
  * GI evaluation for suspected CBD stones and gallbladder disease.

**General Medicine management (11/16 onwards):**

* Volume resuscitation with **normal saline and lactated Ringer’s**.
* Held oral antimicrobials; followed ID’s IV cefiderocol + minocycline regimen.
* Work‑up for dyspnea (D‑dimer, CT chest, troponin, EKG) – no acute cardiopulmonary process.
* Plan to restart **TPN via right IJ Hickman**; nutrition consult initiated.

---

## 4. Biliary Disease, ERCP, and Liver Injury

### 4.1 Imaging and ERCP

**RUQ Ultrasound 11/17/2025:**

* **Choledocholithiasis/sludge** in a dilated CBD.
* **Cholelithiasis** with mild gallbladder wall thickening.
* No convincing acute cholecystitis.

**ERCP 11/19/2025:**

* **Duodenal sphincterotomy** performed.
* **Balloon sweep** of CBD stones/debris.
* **CBD stent** placed.

GI notes specify a plan for **repeat ERCP in 2–3 months** to remove the plastic CBD stent. General Surgery recommends **deferring cholecystectomy** given her extensive prior abdominal surgery, adhesions, and high operative risk; acute cholecystitis is being managed non‑operatively with antibiotics.

### 4.2 Liver Enzymes and DILI Evaluation

After ERCP and ongoing antibiotics, she developed **marked transaminitis**:

* AST up to ~**700 IU/L**, ALT up to ~**850 IU/L** in late November.
* ALP ~**200 IU/L**.
* Total bilirubin only mildly elevated (~**1.1–1.7 mg/dL**).

**HIDA scans:**

* **11/22 HIDA:**

  * No acute cholecystitis, no complete CBD obstruction.
* **11/30 HIDA:**

  * Nonvisualization of the gallbladder at 1 and 4 hours → concerning for **acute cholecystitis**.

**Antibiotic changes over this period:**

* Initially on **cefiderocol + minocycline**.
* As cholecystitis became more likely and Stenotrophomonas coverage remained relevant:

  * Started **meropenem**, later changed to **ertapenem (Invanz)** on **12/1** per ID/GI.

**GI assessment (12/2):**

* Noted LFT pattern now **primarily hepatocellular** (R‑factor ~8).
* ALP and bilirubin largely normalized or trending down, which they felt argued against an ongoing purely cholestatic/obstructive process.
* Concluded likely **drug‑induced liver injury (DILI)**, with:

  * **Minocycline** and possibly **levofloxacin** as primary culprits; both are documented “Class A” hepatotoxins in LiverTox.
  * COVID‑19 infection and acute cholecystitis possible contributors.
* Autoimmune and viral serologies largely unremarkable.
* Ceruloplasmin low but not thought to be driving the acute picture.
* Plan:

  * Continue **ertapenem**.
  * Daily monitoring of LFTs, INR, metabolic panel.
  * No immediate further endoscopic intervention.

**LFT trend around 12/2:**

* As of **12/2:** ALT **732**, AST **356**, ALP **219**, total bilirubin **1.2** (all down from peak).

Later labs (12/3–12/5, from your TEE‑context summary):

* **12/3:** AST **221**, ALT **520**.
* **12/4:** AST **174**, ALT **440**.
* **12/5:** AST **119**, ALT **339**.
* ALP ~**195**, TBili ~**2.3**, DBili ~**0.8**.
* This reflects a **down‑trending** but still abnormal hepatic profile.

---

## 5. Thrombocytopenia, Venous Thromboses, and Anticoagulation

### 5.1 Platelet Trend and Thrombocytopenia

* On admission (11/16): Platelets **~250 K/µL**.
* **11/17:** 216 K.
* Over ~6–7 days, platelets fell to **~30–40 K/µL**.
* Peripheral smear:

  * **Giant thrombocytes**, macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, smudge cells.
  * **No schistocytes** (TTP less likely).

**Hematology consult (11/23):**

* Heparin‑induced thrombocytopenia (HIT/HITT) considered unlikely:

  * She had **refused prophylactic enoxaparin** earlier in the admission.
  * **HIT ELISA (PF4 IgG)** later negative (OD **0.052**).
* Thrombocytopenia assessed as:

  * Likely **cefiderocol‑induced**, a rare but documented adverse effect.
  * Some platelet recovery observed after discontinuing cefiderocol.
* Suggested work‑up included:

  * DIC labs (PT, PTT, fibrinogen).
  * **Antiphospholipid syndrome testing** (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, β2‑glycoprotein).

By early December:

* Platelets in the **40–50 K** range, later noted as around **70–74 K** (e.g., 12/5: Plt **74K**; 12/8: Plt **70K**).

### 5.2 Venous Thromboses and IVC Filter Thrombus

During this admission she developed **acute DVTs**:

* **Left subclavian vein** (via venous duplex).
* **Left soleal vein** (via lower extremity duplex).

Imaging (US/CT) comments also reiterate:

* **Suprarenal IVC filter** with echogenic/hyperdense material consistent with chronic thrombus or filter struts.
* Some notes have misreferenced this as “SVC thrombus,” but this was later clarified as **IVC + filter** (and separately, a potential SVC catheter mass).

### 5.3 Anticoagulation Strategy (Up to Early December)

Because of:

* Multiple new DVTs (arm + leg),
* Chronic IVC filter thrombus,
* High thrombotic risk profile,

she was started on **therapeutic heparin infusion** (initiated 11/27/2025 after DVTs were found on 11/26 duplex):

* Goal: keep PTT in therapeutic range (60–80 seconds at times).
* Hematology explicitly endorsed **full anticoagulation despite platelets <50 K**, given very high clot risk.
* This decision was complicated by:

  * Ongoing bleeding from ECF/ileostomy.
  * Platelets in the 30–50K range.

* Major interruptions included:

  * A hold on **12/2** after significant bleeding from an enterocutaneous fistula (cauterized by CRS with silver nitrate), with platelets in the low 40Ks.
  * A subsequent hold on **12/8** for a suspected right chest wall/axillary hematoma near the tunneled catheter.

* She received at least one **platelet transfusion** (1 unit on 12/4–12/5, coinciding with a rise from the 40Ks into the mid‑70Ks), and **RBC transfusions** when Hgb fell to 6.3–6.9 g/dL.

Heparin was otherwise resumed and continued as tolerated between these bleeding events.

---

## 6. COVID‑19 Infection

* **PCR positive 11/22/2025**.
* Symptoms:

  * Mild dyspnea on exertion.
  * Oxygen saturation 98–99% on room air.
* CXR: no acute infiltrates.
* No remdesivir or steroids were given:

  * She was not hypoxic.
  * Concern for liver injury.
* COVID considered a contributor to systemic inflammation and possibly liver injury.

---

## 7. Neurologic Events and Stroke (12/1–12/2)

### 7.1 Clinical Presentation (Code BAT 12/1)

Timeline (12/1):

* ~02:00:

  * Patient noticed her arms “not cooperating,” clumsiness, difficulty using phone and commode.
* Symptoms partially improved, then recurred.
* ~06:30:

  * Again noted difficulty using arms, especially right‑sided incoordination.
* ~09:30:

  * Nurse observed bilateral upper extremity ataxia and right arm drift → **Code BAT** at 09:35.

On stroke team arrival:

* **NIHSS = 3**, with:

  * Bilateral upper extremity (and right lower extremity) ataxia.
  * Right upper extremity upward drift.
* No aphasia or major sensory loss.

### 7.2 Neuroimaging

**CT Head (≈10:02 on 12/1):**

* Motion degraded.
* **No large acute intracranial hemorrhage**.

**CTA/CTP (initial and repeat):**

* First CTA/CTP: nondiagnostic due to motion.
* Repeat CTA/CTP:

  * **No large vessel occlusion**.
  * Neck and intracranial vessels deemed normal.
  * CT perfusion: no significant abnormality.

**MRI Brain DWI/FLAIR (12/1, reported 12/2):**

* **Acute infarcts** involving:

  * **Left posterior frontal lobe** within the **precentral gyrus** (motor area).
  * Smaller infarct in **right parietal lobe** within **postcentral gyrus** (sensory area).
  * Additional note of small medial right parietal involvement and partial extension into left parietal lobe.
* SWI: no hemorrhage seen.

**MRA Head:**

* No aneurysm, malformation, or large vessel pathology.

### 7.3 Neurologic Examination (12/2)

* Mental status:

  * Alert, oriented, fluent speech.
  * Mild difficulty with complex commands.
  * Subjective feeling: “right hand not cooperating,” but better than initially.
* Motor:

  * 5/5 strength in all extremities.
  * No drift on 12/2 exam (prior exam had subtle “parietal drift” in the right arm).
* Sensory:

  * Intact to light touch and pain.
  * Mild **right‑sided proprioceptive dysfunction**.
* Coordination:

  * Initially: bilateral UE/LE ataxia.
  * By 12/2: mostly resolved; only subtle deficits on finger‑to‑nose with eyes closed.

### 7.4 Neurology Assessment and Plan

* Infarcts characterized as **small–moderate cortical strokes**, likely **embolic**.
* Neurology considers these **embolic strokes in the setting of extensive venous and catheter‑related thrombosis**:

  * Early in the work‑up they suspected a **paradoxical embolus** arising from venous thrombi/IVC filter (before bubble/TEE were completed).
  * After imaging:

    * **TTE with bubble and TEE** showed no PFO or intracardiac right‑to‑left shunt.
    * **TEE (12/5)** revealed a **0.7 x 0.8 cm mobile echodensity adherent to the SVC catheter tip**, consistent with a catheter‑associated thrombus vs vegetation.

  * Patient had been on a **therapeutic heparin drip since 11/27**, so the strokes occurred **despite anticoagulation**.

* Less likely:

  * Atherosclerotic stroke (normal CTA/MRA, low LDL, minimal plaque).

* Not considered candidate for:

  * Thrombolysis (tPA/TNK):

    * Out of time window.
    * Platelets ~40–50 K.
    * On therapeutic heparin.
    * Active bleeding risk.
  * Antiplatelet therapy:

    * Contraindicated by thrombocytopenia and bleeding.
  * Statin:

    * Low yield (non‑atherosclerotic etiology).
    * Problematic given severe transaminitis.

**Neurology Plan:**

* Continue **therapeutic heparin infusion** as only viable stroke + VTE management given constraints.
* Neurologic checks every 4 hours (earlier q2h considered).
* Further work‑up:

  * **Transthoracic echo (TTE) with bubble**:

    * Later reported no PFO (no bubbles in left heart).
  * Subsequent **TEE** (see §9.1 TEE – 12/5/2025 below).
  * Repeat CT head as needed if heparin fully therapeutic and/or clinical changes, to monitor for hemorrhagic transformation.
  * Ongoing search for infectious embolic sources (blood cultures, valve imaging).

By 12/5 Neurology progress note:

* Exam markedly improved:

  * Full 5/5 strength, no drift, no ataxia on finger‑to‑nose or heel‑to‑shin.
  * Normal cranial nerves, sensation, language.
  * Functionally using phone, commode; working with PT/OT.

## 9. TEE, Venogram, and Subsequent Imaging (Early December)

### 9.1 TEE – 12/5/2025

**TEE (12/5/25, 13:46; interpreted by Dr. Tahmid Rahman):**

**Indications:** Evaluate for cardioembolic source and endocarditis in the setting of multifocal embolic strokes and a history of line infections.

**Key findings:**

* **Left/right ventricular function:**

  * Normal LV size and systolic function; **LVEF 60–65%** (visually).
  * Normal RV size and systolic function.

* **Left atrium / left atrial appendage:**

  * No clot in LA or LAA.
  * Normal LAA emptying velocity (~0.49 m/s).

* **Atrial septum / shunt:**

  * Atrial septum structurally normal and intact on 2D and color Doppler.
  * **Agitated saline bubble study:** no bubbles seen in the left heart.
  * Interpretation: **no PFO or intracardiac right‑to‑left shunt detected**.

* **Valves / vegetations:**

  * Aortic valve: normal trileaflet, no stenosis; **trace aortic insufficiency**.
  * Mitral valve: normal; **trace mitral regurgitation**.
  * Tricuspid valve: structurally normal; **no vegetations, trace TR**.
  * Pulmonic valve: normal; **no vegetations, trace PR**.
  * Overall: **No obvious evidence of valvular endocarditis**.

* **Pericardium / aorta:**

  * No pericardial effusion.
  * Aortic root and ascending aorta normal in size.
  * **Small, simple, immobile plaque** in the descending aorta.

* **Critical finding: SVC catheter‑associated mass:**

  * **Small mobile echodensity** in the SVC, measuring **0.7 x 0.8 cm**.
  * Appears **adherent to the tip of the SVC catheter** (right IJ tunneled line).
  * Differential: **catheter‑related thrombus vs catheter‑associated vegetation**.
  * Recommendation: **consider dedicated vascular imaging** for further evaluation.

**TEE overall interpretation:**

* **Rules against:**

  * Left‑sided valvular endocarditis as the stroke source.
  * Left atrial/left atrial appendage thrombus.
  * PFO or intracardiac shunt as a mechanism for paradoxical emboli.
* **Supports:**

  * Presence of a **mobile mass on the SVC catheter tip**, consistent with **catheter‑associated thrombus vs vegetation** in the SVC.

### 9.2 Venous Duplex – Right Upper Extremity (12/5, reported 12/6)

**Study:** “VENOUS R/O DVT RIGHT UPPER” – right arm venous duplex.

**Findings:**

* **Normal/patent**:

  * Internal jugular (proximal, mid, distal), distal subclavian vein (visualized portion), axillary, brachial, ulnar, radial, cephalic, and basilic veins.
* **Non‑visualized**:

  * **Proximal and mid right subclavian vein** not adequately seen.
* Overall impression:

  * **Technically limited** study.
  * No DVT in visualized segments.
  * Cannot exclude clot in **non‑visualized proximal/mid subclavian or SVC**.

### 9.3 CT Venogram Chest with IV Contrast (12/6, reported 12/7)

**CT venogram chest (12/6):**

* **Lungs/pleura:**

  * Clear; no effusion or pneumothorax.
* **Vessels:**

  * Thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery appear normal.
  * Right‑sided **tunneled central venous catheter** with tip in the SVC.
  * Reported: **“No CT evidence of sizable discernible catheter‑associated thrombus”** at the catheter tip.

## 11. Nutrition Status as of 12/8/2025

From 12/8 Nutrition note:

* **TPN and IV lipids**:

  * Were running at **goal rate** previously.
  * **Held on the morning of 12/8** due to **possible central line problem (arm/chest wall pain near line)**.
* Dietitian’s recommendations:

  * If TPN must remain off:

    * Provide **IV dextrose via peripheral IV** to supply calories (glucose) in the interim.
  * Once safe:

    * **Resume full‑dose TPN** at:

      * **67 mL/hr over ~24 hours** for the TPN solution.
      * **SMOFlipid** at **16.6 mL/hr over 12 hours**.
    * This regimen provides approximately:

      * **1,387 kcal/day**.
      * **70 g protein/day**.
      * **40 g fat/day**.
  * Continue **Ensure Clear TID** and **regular/unrestricted diet** as tolerated by the patient.

**Oral intake and weight:**

* Patient reports **very poor appetite** in hospital:

  * Typically **about one meal per day**, often just a few bites.
  * Even when family brings preferred foods (e.g., ice cream sundae), intake is minimal.
* Weight:

  * Last recorded weight on **12/1**: **59.4 kg** (130.7 lb).
  * Down from **66.7 kg (≈147 lb)** in late October.
  * Nutrition requests **updated measured weight**.

## 12. Consolidated Current Status as of 12/8/2025

### 12.1 Active Major Problems

1. **Short‑gut syndrome, TPN‑dependent**, post multiple bowel resections, with:

   * End ileostomy, mucous fistula, and multiple ECFs.
   * Chronic high‑output ostomy and ECFs; intermittent bleeding from fistulas (one cauterized 12/2).

2. **Recurrent, complex line‑associated infections and thromboses**, currently with:

   * Right IJ **tunneled catheter** (placed 11/11/25) in SVC.
   * **TEE (12/5)** showing a **0.7 x 0.8 cm mobile echodensity on SVC catheter tip** (thrombus vs vegetation).
   * **CT venogram (12/6)** showing no large catheter‑tip thrombus but tilted IVC filter with protruding struts.
   * Multiple prior CLABSIs (Staph hominis, Stenotrophomonas, Caballeronia jiangsuensis, MRSE).
   * Recurrent antibiotic courses including cefiderocol, minocycline, meropenem, ertapenem, cefepime, daptomycin, metronidazole, Bactrim, and levofloxacin.

3. **Venous thromboembolism and filter thrombus**:

   * Acute **left subclavian** and **left soleal** DVTs.
   * Chronic **suprarenal IVC filter** with associated thrombus/tilted struts.
   * Now **SVC catheter‑associated thrombus** on TEE.

4. **Acute embolic strokes (12/1)**:

   * MRI: acute infarcts in **left precentral gyrus** and **right postcentral gyrus**, with some additional parietal involvement.
   * CTA/MRA: no large vessel occlusion; neck and intracranial arteries normal.
   * Clinically:

     * Initial bilateral UE ataxia and right arm drift.
     * By 12/5, neurologic exam essentially normalized; PT/OT ongoing.

5. **Severe thrombocytopenia**:

   * Platelets dropped from ~250K at admission to ~30–40K within a week.
   * Likely **cefiderocol‑associated**, with some recovery after the drug was discontinued.
   * HIT ruled out (no heparin initially, PF4 IgG negative).
   * Platelets ~70–74K by 12/5–12/8.

6. **Bleeding and anemia**:

   * Recurrent bleeding from **ECF/ostomy region**, with Hgb nadirs:

     * ~**6.3 g/dL** (earlier severe anemia event).
     * **6.9 g/dL** on 12/7, requiring transfusion.
   * As of 12/8:

     * Hgb **9.4 g/dL** after transfusions.
   * New suspected bleed:

     * **Right axillary/chest wall hematoma** near the tunneled catheter, with pain and fullness.
     * Ultrasound at bedside suggested bleeding.
     * CT chest with contrast ordered for hematoma evaluation.
   * Response:

     * **Heparin drip and TPN suspended** on 12/8 pending further imaging and stability assessment.

7. **Acute cholecystitis / choledocholithiasis**:

   * ERCP (11/19) with sphincterotomy, CBD sweep, and stent placement.
   * HIDA (11/30) consistent with acute cholecystitis.
   * US: hydronephrotic gallbladder with multiple stones, CBD dilation.
   * Considered a high‑risk surgical candidate; cholecystectomy deferred.
   * Managed medically with antibiotics (cefepime, daptomycin, metronidazole; previously ertapenem, meropenem).

8. **Severe transaminitis and DILI**:

   * AST up to ~700, ALT up to ~850 in late November, with mild ALP/bili elevation.
   * GI, ID, and Medicine concur that **minocycline (and possibly levofloxacin)** are likely causes, with COVID‑19 and cholecystitis as contributors.
   * After stopping minocycline:

     * AST/ALT down‑trending but still elevated as of 12/8 (AST 32, ALT 135; Alk Phos 153; albumin 2.4).

9. **COVID‑19 infection**:

   * PCR positive 11/22.
   * Mild clinical course, no hypoxia.

### 12.2 Current Treatments and Holds (as of 12/8)

* **Antimicrobials:**

  * **Cefepime** IV, **daptomycin** IV, **metronidazole (Flagyl)** IV, **nystatin** oral.
  * Prior Invanz (ertapenem) stopped 12/3.

* **Anticoagulation:**

  * **Heparin IV infusion** was being used at therapeutic dose for DVT and stroke prevention, but:

    * As of **12/8**, **heparin drip is suspended** because of suspected chest wall/axillary hematoma near the tunneled catheter.

* **Fluids and nutrition:**

  * **Lactated Ringers** at 80 mL/hr.
  * **SMOFlipid** running.
  * **TPN:** ordered but **clinically held** as of 12/8 due to line/hematoma concerns.
  * Plan to use **peripheral IV dextrose** if TPN remains off, and to resume full TPN/SMOF once it is safe.

* **GI/ostomy management:**

  * Ongoing local care for ileostomy and ECFs.
  * Silver nitrate cauterization of a bleeding fistula (12/2).

* **Rehabilitation:**

  * **PT/OT** for stroke recovery and general deconditioning.

### 12.3 Hemodynamic and Laboratory Snapshot (12/8)

## Appendix A – CT Chest with IV Contrast (12/8/2025)

**Study:** CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST
**Date/Time:** 12/8/2025 14:53 EST (Accession 12555699)
**Ordering provider:** Dr. Zaid Iqbal
**Clinical indication:**
“Concern for bleeding vs abscess vs infiltration of TPN right axillary region proximal to tunneled catheter line” – i.e., evaluation of **right axillary/chest wall pain and suspected hematoma or line‑related complication**.

### A.1 Technique and Comparison

* Axial CT images from **thoracic inlet to adrenals**, with sagittal and coronal reformats.
* IV contrast: **Omnipaque 350, 80 mL** (non‑ionic).
* Radiation dose: CTDIvol mean 4.24 mGy; DLP 187.95 mGy·cm.
* Technologist note: **patient unable to raise right arm above head** (consistent with her pain and limited ROM).
* **Comparison study:** CT venogram chest with IV contrast from **12/6/2025**.

---

### A.2 Key Anatomic Findings (Structured by Region)

#### 1. Devices

* **Right IJ tunneled central venous catheter:**
  * Tip is in the **mid SVC**, **unchanged** from prior.
  * Proximal catheter **tunnels through subcutaneous fat in the anterior right chest wall** (course passes near the area of her current pain and the newly imaged collection).

#### 2. Lungs and Airways

* **Patchy airspace opacities** in the **anterior portions of both upper lobes**:
  * Described on series 901, images 52–70.
  * Radiologist: **“Correlate for pneumonia.”**
* **Left apical pleural–parenchymal scarring** – unchanged, likely chronic.
* **Linear opacities** in both lung bases – interpreted as **atelectasis or scarring**.
* Central airways: **patent**.
* No mention of mass or large consolidations beyond the described anterior upper lobe opacities.

**Clinical implication:**
Compared to prior CXRs (which showed no definite focal consolidation and only a trace right pleural effusion/atelectasis), CT now shows **bilateral anterior upper‑lobe patchy opacities** that could represent **infectious pneumonia** (bacterial, viral, or aspiration) or other inflammatory processes. The report explicitly recommends clinical correlation for **pneumonia**.

#### 3. Pleura and Pleural Space

* **No pleural effusion.**
* No pleural mass.
* No pneumothorax.

**Note:** This contrasts slightly with the 12/8 portable CXR, which described a **trace right pleural effusion** with adjacent hazy opacity. CT (more sensitive for small fluid collections) now reports **no effusion**, suggesting any prior effusion was **minimal and/or resolved** or below detection threshold at the time of CT.

#### 4. Mediastinum, Lymph Nodes, Neck Base

* **No significant intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.**
* No pathologically enlarged axillary or other nodes.
* Neck base: no focal lesion; **thyroid normal**.

#### 5. Cardiovascular Structures

* **Heart size and pulmonary vascularity**: within normal limits.
* **Mild coronary artery calcifications** (consistent with known non‑obstructive CAD).
* **Aorta and main pulmonary artery**: normal caliber.
* No pericardial effusion described.

#### 6. Upper Abdomen (Partially Imaged)

* **Biliary tree:**
  * **CBD stent** is in place (as expected from prior ERCP on 11/19).
  * **Pneumobilia** is again demonstrated (air in the biliary tree—expected in the setting of prior sphincterotomy/stent).
* **Gallbladder:**
  * High‑density material in the gallbladder on the last image:
    * Not fully characterized here but described as likely **sludge or calculus** (consistent with known cholelithiasis).
* **IVC filter:**
  * An IVC filter is noted with **legs abutting the portal vein**.
    * This is consistent with prior comments that the **suprarenal IVC filter’s struts extend beyond the IVC**.
    * Here, the report emphasizes that the filter legs **abut the portal vein** in the upper abdomen.
* **Abdominal wound/fistula region:**
  * A **partially imaged abdominal wound** is seen on the last image; not fully characterized on this chest‑focused study.

**Clinical implication:**

* The CT confirms:
  * **CBD stent remains in situ**.
  * **Cholelithiasis/sludge** persists.
  * **Pneumobilia** is expected post‑ERCP and biliary instrumentation.
* The IVC filter description adds an important nuance: **filter legs now documented as abutting the portal vein**, underscoring their extra‑caval extension and close relationship to major abdominal vasculature. This supports prior concerns raised on CT venogram (tilted filter with struts beyond IVC) and underlies Vascular Surgery’s and Radiology’s recommendations to consider IR consultation.

#### 7. Musculoskeletal and Chest Wall – Critical Finding

* **Right subpectoral fluid collection**:

  * Location:
    * Deep to the right pectoral region (“subpectoral”), on the side of her **tunneled catheter** and **axillary/chest wall pain**.
  * Size:
    * **7.7 x 7.6 x 5.1 cm**.
  * Internal characteristics:
    * **Layering hyperdensity**, indicating dependent high‑density material within the collection.
    * Radiologist: “compatible with **hematoma**.”
  * Vascular relationships:
    * **Right subclavian artery and vein appear patent.**
  * Importantly:
    * **No evidence of active contrast extravasation** is seen.

* Impression line (verbatim):

  > “Right subpectoral fluid collection with layering dependent hyperdensity compatible with hematoma. No evidence of active extravasation.”

* Notification:

  * Labeled a **critical result**.
  * Dr. Jennifer Martino notified Dr. Zaid Iqbal on **12/8/2025 at 3:41 PM**; read‑back confirmed.

**Clinical implication:**

* This confirms that the clinical suspicion of a **right chest wall/axillary hematoma** is correct.
* Key points:
  * It is **large** (roughly 7–8 cm).
  * It appears to be a **contained subpectoral hematoma** rather than a small superficial bruise.
  * **No CT evidence of active arterial extravasation** at the time of imaging – suggesting no high‑flow ongoing arterial bleed visible on this scan.
  * **Right subclavian vessels are patent**, and there is no obvious arterial occlusion or pseudoaneurysm described.
* The hematoma’s location along the course of the **tunneled catheter** plus the clinical context (therapeutic heparin, thrombocytopenia, TPN infusion, acute chest wall pain) is highly consistent with a **catheter‑track–related or chest wall soft‑tissue bleed** that has now organized into a sizable hematoma.

---

### A.3 Integrated Interpretation in Context of Current Status

1. **Right chest wall hematoma (primary reason for this CT):**

   * CT confirms a **large right subpectoral hematoma** deep to the right pectoral muscles, without CT evidence of active contrast extravasation.
   * This fully supports:
     * The 12/8 bedside concern for bleeding near the tunneled catheter.
     * The decision documented in the 12/8 General Medicine note to **suspend the heparin drip and hold TPN** while imaging was obtained.
   * The absence of active extravasation on CT does **not** rule out slow venous or low‑flow oozing, but there is **no radiologic evidence of a major ongoing high‑flow arterial bleed** at scan time.

2. **Central line position:**

   * The **right IJ tunneled Hickman** remains in **good SVC position**.
   * The subcutaneous tunneling path runs near the region of the hematoma, but the catheter tip itself is unchanged in the mid SVC.

3. **Pulmonary findings:**

   * Compared with prior plain films (which showed no overt consolidation and only a trace effusion), CT now shows:
     * **Patchy anterior upper‑lobe opacities bilaterally**, with a specific suggestion to **correlate for pneumonia**.
     * Basilar linear opacities, likely **atelectasis or scarring**.
   * In the context of known **COVID‑19 positivity** and multiple antibiotics, these opacities could reflect:
     * Superimposed **bacterial pneumonia**,
     * Viral pneumonitis,
     * Aspiration or other inflammatory processes.
   * There is **no pleural effusion or pneumothorax**.

4. **Biliary system and IVC filter:**

   * The study confirms:
     * **CBD stent still in place**, with **pneumobilia** and **gallbladder sludge/stones**, consistent with her ERCP history and acute cholecystitis.
     * **IVC filter** with legs that **abut the portal vein**, in keeping with previous descriptions of a tilted filter with struts extending beyond the IVC.
   * This reinforces:
     * The chronic, complex nature of her filter position.
     * The rationale for **Vascular Surgery and Radiology recommending IR evaluation** for potential filter retrieval or management, if clinically feasible.

---

### A.4 Bottom Line from the 12/8 CT Chest

* **Confirms a large right subpectoral hematoma** adjacent to the tunneled catheter track, without CT evidence of active arterial extravasation.
* **Supports holding heparin and TPN** while this hematoma is evaluated and managed.
* **Shows patchy anterior upper‑lobe opacities** compatible with **pneumonia**, warranting correlation with symptoms, labs, and current antimicrobial coverage.
* **Re‑demonstrates**:
  * A **CBD stent**, pneumobilia, and gallbladder sludge/stones.
  * A **tilted suprarenal IVC filter** with legs abutting the **portal vein**, underscoring the previously recognized filter malposition/strut extension.

## Appendix B – 12/9/2025 Inpatient Updates (Gen Med, ID, Nutrition)

This appendix synthesizes the **12/9/2025 General Medicine, Infectious Disease, and Nutrition notes**. It is focused on what they add or clarify relative to the main body of the report (which already covers history, prior admissions, imaging through 12/8, and the 12/8 CT chest in Appendix A).

---

### B.1 Day‑of‑Care Overview (12/9)

- **Clinical impression on rounds (Gen Med & ID):**
  - Patient is **afebrile, hemodynamically stable**, in **no acute distress**, and described as **non‑toxic**.
  - She is **ambulating on the unit**, feels **“better”**, and **denies pain or new symptoms** at the time of ID exam.
  - ROS is broadly negative (no chest pain, SOB, new GI symptoms, urinary symptoms, neuro complaints), aside from expected ostomy/fistula findings.
- **Neurologic status:**
  - Still **alert and oriented x3**.
  - No new focal deficits documented; neurologic ROS is negative.
  - Functional status: uses the unit, moving about, participating in care; consistent with ongoing recovery from prior small cortical strokes.

Overall, compared with the 12/8 snapshot, the 12/9 notes portray a patient who is **clinically stable to slightly improved**, despite ongoing complex issues with bleeding risk and thrombosis.

---

### B.2 Right Chest Wall Hematoma & Hemoglobin Course

The 12/8 CT chest (detailed in Appendix A) established a **large right subpectoral hematoma** along the tunneled catheter tract, with **no active contrast extravasation**. The 12/9 notes add:

- **Symptoms and exam:**
  - Right axillary/chest wall region:
    - **Less pain**, improved range of motion in the right upper extremity.
    - Gen Med exam: **“Improvement of the patient’s right axillary region”**; skin warm and dry.
  - Pulmonary and cardiac exams remain benign (clear lungs, regular heart rate/rhythm).

- **Hemoglobin trajectory and attribution of blood loss:**
  - 12/8 21:51 – Hgb **7.5 g/dL**, Hct 22.4%, Plt 88K.
  - 12/9 04:21 – Hgb **6.9 g/dL (critical)**, Hct 20.8%; prompted **1 unit PRBC** overnight.
  - Later on 12/9 – Hgb improves (documented values range from **7.5–9.4 g/dL** in different draws and summary tables; ID notes 7.9 g/dL, GM lab panel shows 9.4 g/dL at ~06:00).
  - Gen Med explicitly attributes this drop as:
    > “drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit, unexpected secondary to **spontaneous chest wall hematoma**”
  - Importantly:
    - **No evidence of active bleeding from the ostomy bag** on 12/9 (ostomy output described as brown stool by Gen Med; ID notes ostomy with green output and only blood staining around a left‑sided fistula, not heavy bleeding).

- **Interpretation:**
  - The hematoma is now treated as the **primary source of recent blood loss** (including the new nadir of Hgb 6.9 on 12/9).
  - Clinically, the hematoma appears **contained and improving symptomatically**; there is no imaging evidence of brisk arterial bleeding and no expansion suggested by exam.

---

### B.3 Anticoagulation & IVC Filter Plan

The major new operational decision on 12/9 is how to balance **acute VTE/stroke risk** against this hematoma.

- **Current anticoagulation status:**
  - **Heparin drip (therapeutic)** – **suspended**:
    - Order shows a continuous heparin infusion (25,000 Units in 250 mL NS) at **600 Units/hr**, now marked **“Suspended”**.
    - aPTT on 12/9 is **26 sec** (normal), consistent with **no active heparin**.
  - **Enoxaparin (Lovenox) prophylaxis** 40 mg SC daily – also **suspended**.
  - **Mechanical VTE prophylaxis** in place:
    - Bilateral calf **sequential compression devices (SCDs)** since 11/22.

- **Planned timing and rationale:**
  - Gen Med explicitly documents:
    - Continue **pressure dressing** over the chest wall hematoma.
    - Keep patient **off heparin drip for 48 hours**.
    - **Plan to resume heparin gtt “tomorrow” after IVC filter retrieval**.
  - In other words:
    - Short, clearly defined window **off systemic anticoagulation** to stabilize the hematoma and allow for an **attempt at IVC filter retrieval**, after which **full‑dose heparin** is intended to resume.

- **Thrombotic disease recap in these notes:**
  - **Upper and lower extremity DVTs**:
    - **Partial acute thrombus in the left mid subclavian vein**.
    - **Acute thrombus in the left soleal vein** (calf DVT).
  - **SVC catheter‑associated mass**:
    - TEE (12/5) again cited as showing a **mobile echodensity on the tip of the SVC catheter**, likely **thrombus vs. vegetation**, with no valve involvement or left‑sided endocarditis.
  - **Chronic suprarenal IVC filter**:
    - CT venogram (12/6) reiterated:
      - Filter is **tilted**, with multiple struts **extending beyond the IVC**.
      - No **“sizable”** catheter‑tip thrombus; however, the filter’s position is abnormal.
      - Reviewed with **IR**, who initially recommended **no intervention** and noted no large clot.
    - The 12/9 plan upgrades this from “consider IR evaluation” to a **scheduled attempt at IVC filter retrieval**, which is now explicitly driving anticoagulation timing.

- **Internal documentation inconsistency:**
  - In the DVT problem section, a line still reads **“Plan – c/w Hep GTT”**, but this is contradicted by:
    - The **suspended** heparin order,
    - The **normal aPTT**,
    - The explicit plan to keep heparin **off for 48 hours** and resume after filter retrieval.
  - The operative reality is: **heparin is off**, and resumption is tied to the filter procedure.

Net effect: as of 12/9, the team is **temporarily prioritizing hemorrhage control** and procedural planning over continuous anticoagulation, but with a clear intention to **re‑start therapeutic heparin** quickly once the IVC filter issue is addressed.

---

### B.4 Thrombocytopenia & Hematologic Status

The 12/9 notes provide an updated snapshot of the recovery from severe drug‑associated thrombocytopenia:

- **Platelet trend:**
  - 12/8 06:00 – Plt **70 K/µL**.
  - 12/8 21:51 – Plt **88 K/µL**.
  - 12/9 04:21 – Plt **91 K/µL**.
  - Later 12/9 (ID table) – Plt **98 K/µL**.
- **Morphology:**
  - Peripheral smear continues to show:
    - **Giant platelets**.
    - **Mild anisopoikilocytosis** (anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, burr cells, target cells, macrocytosis, polychromasia rated 1+).
    - Occasional **nucleated RBCs** (1–2 per 100 WBC).
- **Coagulation:**
  - PT **~11 sec**, **INR 1.0**.
  - aPTT **26 sec** off heparin (therapeutic range was previously 40–50+ sec while on drip).
- **Hematology assessment (as reflected in Gen Med note):**
  - **HIT is very unlikely**:
    - She had **refused prophylactic enoxaparin** earlier.
    - **PF4/HIT antibody** was negative.
  - Thrombocytopenia deemed **multifactorial**, with **cefiderocol** a key suspect; platelets are now **steadily improving**.
  - **LDH** is within normal limits.
  - **Haptoglobin low**, interpreted as likely due to **frequent transfusions** rather than active hemolysis.
  - Bilirubin on 12/6 was within normal limits.
  - No laboratory or clinical evidence of **DIC** or **consumptive coagulopathy**.

Net: Platelet counts have risen from the 30–40K nadir to **upper‑80s–90s**, moving toward a safer zone for both anticoagulation and invasive procedures.

### B.5 Infectious Disease Status & Antibiotic Strategy

The 12/9 ID note consolidates prior infection history and makes **critical antibiotic changes**.

#### B.5.1 Status of Prior Bacteremias and Endocarditis Workup

- **Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia** (11/5):
  - Origin: prior **LIJ Hickman** (removed 11/5).
  - Treated with:
    - IV **cefiderocol + minocycline**, then
    - Oral **levofloxacin + minocycline**.
  - **Total course completed by 11/29**.
  - Subsequent **blood cultures on 11/16, 11/22, and 12/2 are all negative**.
- **Staph hominis bacteremia** and other line infections:
  - All previously described episodes are acknowledged again; none are active.
- **TEE findings and IE concern:**
  - TEE (12/5) reconfirmed:
    - **No valvular vegetations** or left‑sided endocarditis.
    - **No PFO or intracardiac shunt**.
    - **Mobile echodensity on SVC catheter tip**, interpreted as **thrombus vs. catheter‑associated vegetation**.
  - ID’s operational stance:
    - With **serial negative blood cultures**, absence of valve involvement, and no systemic signs of sepsis, the **likelihood of active endocarditis is low**.
    - The SVC lesion is treated primarily as a **thrombotic complication** in the context of extensive venous disease.

#### B.5.2 Current Infectious Issues (as ID frames them)

- **Acute embolic strokes** (left frontal, right parietal) – etiology unclear, but now more strongly framed as **embolic with a thrombotic/catheter component** rather than frank infective endocarditis.
- **SVC thrombus and LE DVT** – as above, central to risk/benefit decisions on anticoagulation.
- **Choledocholithiasis with cholecystitis**:
  - s/p **ERCP with CBD stent placement and stone sweep** on 11/19.
  - **HIDA positive** for cholecystitis on 11/30.
  - Managed medically; no interval procedures since status report.
- **Anemia and thrombocytopenia** – ongoing but improving.
- **Transaminitis** – **down‑trending**, consistent with DILI recovery.
- **COVID‑19**:
  - Positive on **11/23** (ID note says 11/23; main report uses 11/22).
  - Symptoms remain **very mild**; patient on **room air**, no hypoxia.
  - No remdesivir or steroids.

#### B.5.3 Antibiotic Changes on 12/9

Prior to 12/9 (per main report and 12/8 notes), she was on:

- **Cefepime** 2 g q8h IV.
- **Daptomycin** 8 mg/kg IV daily.
- **Metronidazole (Flagyl)** 500 mg IV q8h.
- **Nystatin oral** for thrush prophylaxis.

On 12/9, **ID makes a clear de‑escalation**:

- **Continue:**
  - **Cefepime 2 g IV q8h**:
    - Chosen because she has **previously tolerated cefepime**.
    - Provides **broad coverage**, including biliary and line‑related pathogens.
- **Stop:**
  - **Daptomycin.**
  - **Metronidazole (Flagyl).**
- **Maintain:**
  - **Nystatin oral** for mucosal candidiasis prophylaxis/treatment.
- **Monitor:**
  - Follow up **blood cultures** (currently negative).
  - Ongoing clinical status and labs (WBC ~10–13K, but stable).

This is an important shift: from a **triple IV antibiotic regimen** back to **single‑agent cefepime**, reflecting confidence that:

- Stenotrophomonas bacteremia is fully treated.
- There is no ongoing bacteremia or endocarditis.
- Biliary/sepsis control is now primarily directed at **post‑ERCP cholecystitis** and line‑related risks, covered by cefepime.

---

### B.6 Biliary Disease, Liver Injury, and COVID (12/9 Framing)

No new biliary procedures were performed on 12/9, but the notes reaffirm and slightly reframe prior conclusions:

- **Biliary disease:**
  - **ERCP 11/19:** CBD stone sweep and **plastic stent placement** (CBD stent still in place on cross‑sectional imaging).
  - **HIDA 11/30:** Nonvisualization of gallbladder at 1 and 4 hours → **suspicious for acute cholecystitis**.
  - **General Surgery:** Continues to **defer cholecystectomy** given high surgical risk and complex abdomen; outpatient evaluation planned once stable.
  - Clinically on 12/9:
    - Abdomen soft, non‑tender, non‑distended on both Gen Med and ID exams.
    - No new biliary‑specific complaints (no RUQ pain, no jaundice progression).

- **Liver function / DILI:**
  - LFTs cited are the **12/8 values**:
    - AST **32 IU/L**.
    - ALT **135 IU/L** (down from peak ~850).
    - ALP **153 IU/L** (mildly elevated).
    - Total bilirubin **0.7 mg/dL**, direct **0.4 mg/dL**.
    - Albumin **2.4 g/dL**, total protein **4.7 g/dL**.
  - Both Gen Med and ID summarize this as **“transaminitis down‑trending,” consistent with improving DILI** (minocycline ± other drugs), superimposed on COVID and cholecystitis.

- **COVID‑19:**
  - Remains **mild**:
    - On **room air**, SpO₂ **98–99%**.
    - No new infiltrates on plain films (12/7–12/8 CXRs show at most trace effusion/atelectasis).
  - Management:
    - **No remdesivir**, no steroids, given lack of hypoxia and hepatic considerations.

No new imaging on 12/9 changes the biliary/COVID story; rather, the notes confirm the **improving LFT trend** and the decision to **continue conservative, antibiotic‑based management**.

---

### B.7 Neurologic/Stroke Status on 12/9

The 12/9 General Medicine and ID notes do not introduce new stroke imaging, but they:

- Re‑summarize:
  - **MRI (12/1):** Acute infarcts in the **left precentral gyrus** (posterior frontal) and **right postcentral gyrus** (parietal), with no large vessel occlusion on CTA/MRA.
  - **Serial CTs (12/2, 12/4):** Show evolving infarcts without hemorrhagic conversion.
  - **TTE with bubble:** No right‑to‑left shunt (no bubble passage to left heart).
  - **TEE (12/5):** No LA/LAA thrombus, no PFO, no valvular vegetations; SVC catheter tip mass as above.

- Clinical state on 12/9:
  - Neurologic exam by both services is normal enough that neurologic ROS is **explicitly negative** (no dizziness, confusion, headache, new weakness).
  - She is **ambulating** in the unit and neurologically **stable**.

Stroke management implicates anticoagulation strategy (see B.3): the team accepts a brief period without heparin due to the hematoma, with a plan to restart after IVC filter management.

---

### B.8 Nutrition, TPN, Fluids, and Weight

The main report already summarized TPN composition; the 12/9 Nutrition note provides an explicit **status update and monitoring plan**.

- **Diet orders:**
  - **Unrestricted, regular diet**, thin liquids.
  - **Ensure Clear** oral supplement **TID** since 11/18.
  - RDs/CDNs empowered to adjust diet as needed.

- **TPN & SMOF lipid status:**
  - After the hematoma‑related hold on 12/8, **TPN was cleared to resume “yesterday afternoon” (12/8) after CT chest**, and:
    - As of 12/9 morning, **both TPN and SMOFlipid “are now running at goal.”**
  - Active TPN prescription:
    - **TPN – Adult Special Formula**
      - 1,600 mL/day via central line.
      - Run at **67 mL/hr** over ~24 hours.
    - **SMOFlipid 20% 40 g/day**
      - 200 mL at **16.6 mL/hr** over 12 hours.
  - The regimen is essentially the same as described in the main report (~1,387 kcal/day, 70 g protein, 40 g fat), just reconfirmed as **back at full dose**.

- **Electrolytes & adjustments:**
  - **Sodium 133 mmol/L** on 12/9 (slightly low).
  - Dietitian notes that because she **did not receive the full TPN bag on 12/8**, they will **monitor Na** before changing TPN sodium content.
  - Other electrolytes are acceptable:
    - K 4.7, Mg 1.7, Phos 3.7, Ca 7.9 (chronically low‑normal to low).

- **Monitoring plan (TPN‑specific):**
  - **Daily** Chem‑8, Mg, Phos until stable, then **twice weekly**.
  - **POC glucose q4h** at initiation and dose changes, then daily once stable (goal 70–180 mg/dL).
  - **Weekly**: CBC, LFTs, triglycerides, CRP, prealbumin.
  - **Strict I/Os** and **daily weights**.
  - Reassessment timing per institutional **Level of Care Policy III**.

- **Fluids & volume status:**
  - In addition to TPN and lipids, she is on **Lactated Ringers 80 mL/hr**.
  - I/O summary (24‑hour windows starting 07:00):
    - 12/7: intake ~**3982 mL**, output **1600 mL**, net **+2382 mL**.
    - 12/8: intake ~**3360 mL**, output **2600 mL**, net **+760 mL**.
    - 12/9 (partial): intake **1295 mL**, output **900 mL**, net **+395 mL**.
  - This confirms a **recent net positive fluid balance**, driven by IV fluids, TPN, and blood products.

- **Weight:**
  - New measured weight on 12/9: **63.4 kg** at 10:25.
  - Previously documented hospital weight was **59.4 kg** on 12/1.
  - The ~4 kg increase likely reflects a combination of fluid resuscitation, transfusions, and stabilization of nutritional support rather than purely lean mass gain.

---

### B.10 EMR Problem List, Allergies, and Medication Context

The Gen Med note also provides a **structured EMR snapshot** that aligns with, but does not substantially change, existing information:

- **Active EMR problems** (already covered in main text but listed explicitly):
  - Anemia; at risk of VTE; coagulopathy; frequent admissions; history of COVID‑19; history of falls; obesity; “procedure contraindicated”; ulcerative colitis.
- **Allergies:**
  - **Codeine** (reaction not specified).
  - **Vancomycin** – rash.
  - **Piperacillin‑tazobactam (Zosyn)** – welt.

- **Medication context:**
  - Active med list is broadly similar to that already described (LR, cefepime, daptomycin, Flagyl, nystatin, TPN, SMOFlipid, losartan, loperamide, Gattex, PRN antiemetics/analgesics).
  - Importantly:
    - **Heparin drip and enoxaparin are suspended**.
    - **SCDs are in place**.
    - **ID explicitly recommends stopping daptomycin and Flagyl**, leaving **cefepime as the primary systemic antibiotic**.

## Appendix C – 12/10/2025 General Medicine and Interventional Radiology Updates

This appendix summarizes the **12/10/2025 General Medicine progress note** and the **12/10/2025 Interventional Radiology (IR) progress note**, focusing on new information and trends relative to the status through 12/9.

---

### C.1 Day-of-Care Overview (12/10/2025)

- **Clinical impression (Gen Med):**
  - Patient examined on morning rounds.
  - **Denies any acute complaints**, including:
    - No worsening **right axillary/chest wall pain**.
    - No new dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, or neurologic symptoms.
  - **Review of systems** (other than known issues) is negative: respiratory, cardiovascular, GI, musculoskeletal, skin, neurologic, psychiatric all documented as negative.

- **Vital signs (most recent):**
  - Temp: **36.9°C** (oral).
  - HR: **91 bpm**.
  - RR: **17**.
  - SpO₂: **99% on room air**.
  - Weight: **63.4 kg** (12/9); Height: **170.2 cm** → BMI ≈ **21.9**.
  - Overall: Hemodynamically **stable**, afebrile, non‑hypoxic.

- **Physical exam:**
  - General: **No acute distress**.
  - Lungs: Non‑labored respirations; symmetric chest wall expansion.
  - Heart: Normal rate and regular rhythm.
  - Abdomen: Soft, non‑tender, non‑distended; **ostomy with brown stool** (no active bleeding described).
  - Skin: Warm, dry.
  - Neuro: Alert and oriented ×3; no new focal deficits.
  - Psych: Cooperative, appropriate mood and affect.

Overall, compared with 12/9, the 12/10 exam reinforces that she is **clinically stable and slightly improving**, particularly with respect to pain from the right chest wall hematoma.

---

### C.2 Chest Wall Hematoma, Anemia, and Thrombocytopenia

#### C.2.1 Chest Wall Hematoma

- The **large right subpectoral/chest wall hematoma** (documented on CT chest 12/8) remains the presumed source of recent blood loss.
- On 12/10:
  - The patient **denies worsening right axillary pain**.
  - Prior note (12/9) already described **improvement in pain and range of motion** after pressure dressing.
  - No new imaging on 12/10; management remains **conservative** with pressure dressings and monitoring.
  - No signs of hemodynamic instability or rapidly falling hemoglobin that would suggest re‑bleeding.

#### C.2.2 Anemia

- **Hemoglobin trend around 12/10:**
  - 12/9 04:21 – Hgb **6.9 g/dL** (critical, attributed largely to the hematoma) → transfused.
  - Subsequent 12/9 labs – Hgb around **7.9–8.1 g/dL**.
  - 12/10 03:58 – Hgb **8.1 g/dL**, Hct **23.8–24.3%** (low but stable).
- Interpretation:
  - Post‑transfusion **Hgb is stable in the low 8s**, without new documented precipitous drops.
  - No active GI or ostomy bleeding is described on 12/10 (ostomy output is **brown stool**, not bloody).
  - The hematoma remains the primary identified bleeding site, but appears **contained** and **clinically improving**.

#### C.2.3 Thrombocytopenia

- **Platelet trend:**
  - 12/8 – **70–88 K/µL**.
  - 12/9 – **91–112 K/µL**.
  - 12/10 03:58 – **119 K/µL**.
- Peripheral smear continues to show:
  - **Giant platelets** present.
  - Mild RBC morphologic changes: anisocytosis, macrocytosis, ovalocytes, poikilocytosis, polychromasia, target cells; occasional nucleated RBCs.
- Coagulation:
  - PT **10.0–11.0 sec**, INR **0.9–1.0**.
  - aPTT **~26 sec** (normal, consistent with **no active heparin infusion**).
- Hematology’s prior assessment remains supported:
  - **HIT very unlikely** (no exposure initially; PF4/HIT antibody negative).
  - Thrombocytopenia is **multifactorial**, with **cefiderocol** considered a major driver; platelets are **clearly recovering**.
  - No evidence of DIC or ongoing consumptive coagulopathy.

Net: By 12/10, she has **stable anemia in the low 8s** and **improving thrombocytopenia (~119K)** in the context of a **contained, non‑expanding chest wall hematoma**.

---

### C.3 Thrombosis, Stroke History, Anticoagulation, and IVC Filter Plan

#### C.3.1 Thromboses and Stroke (Recap)

The 12/10 General Medicine note reiterates prior problems:

- **Acute embolic strokes** (12/1):
  - MRI: acute infarcts in **left posterior frontal/precentral gyrus** and **right parietal/postcentral gyrus**.
  - CTA/MRA: no large vessel occlusion.
  - TTE with bubble (12/2): no right‑to‑left shunt.
  - CTs on 12/2 and 12/4: evolving infarcts, **no hemorrhagic conversion**.
  - TEE (12/5): no PFO, no LA/LAA thrombus, **mobile echodensity on SVC catheter tip** (thrombus vs catheter vegetation).
  - Clinically, neurologic exam remains **stable and essentially normal** by 12/10.

- **Venous thromboses and catheter‑associated thrombus:**
  - **Left mid subclavian vein** partial acute thrombus.
  - **Left soleal vein** acute DVT.
  - **SVC catheter‑associated mass** on TEE (likely thrombus related to right IJ Hickman).
  - **Suprarenal IVC filter** (placed ~2009) with struts extending beyond the IVC and abutting the portal vein (from earlier CT venogram and CT chest).

#### C.3.2 Anticoagulation Status on 12/10

- **Orders / MAR:**
  - **Heparin infusion** (therapeutic) and **enoxaparin prophylaxis** are both explicitly listed under **“Suspended Medications”**:
    - Enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily – suspended since early in admission.
    - Heparin drip (25,000 U in 250 mL NS at 600 U/hr) – status **“Suspended”**; start time 12/2 but currently off.
  - aPTT is normal (~25–26 sec), which is consistent with **no active heparin drip**.
- **Mechanical prophylaxis:**
  - Bilateral calf **sequential compression devices (SCDs)** remain in place since 11/22.
- **Plan statements:**
  - In the DVT section, a templated line still reads **“Plan – c/w Hep GTT”** (continue heparin drip).
  - Elsewhere in the note, however, the **operational reality** is that the heparin drip remains **suspended** because of the chest wall hematoma and ongoing bleeding risk.
  - A separate section states:
    - “Plan to **resume heparin gtt after IVC filter retrieval with IR**.”
- Reconciling:
  - As of **12/10**, the patient remains **off systemic anticoagulation**, with:
    - **Therapeutic heparin** held.
    - **Lovenox** prophylaxis held.
  - Stroke and DVT history, and the SVC thrombus, still make her **high thrombotic risk**, but bleeding risk from the hematoma has led to this deliberate pause.

#### C.3.3 IVC Filter – 12/10 IR Bedside Consultation

The IR progress note on 12/10 documents a **bedside consultation** specifically regarding potential **IVC filter retrieval**:

- **History:**
  - Filter placed **~16 years ago** at Mount Sinai.
  - Attempted retrieval **2 weeks after placement** was unsuccessful.
- **Discussion with patient and daughter:**
  - Risks of leaving the filter in place:
    - Potential for **future thrombus**.
    - **Back pain** or discomfort.
    - Further **protrusion of filter struts** outside the IVC.
    - Future retrieval becoming **more difficult**.
  - Risks of retrieval:
    - **IVC injury** potentially requiring **stent placement**.
    - General procedural risks (not enumerated in full but implied).
  - IR emphasized:
    - **Current techniques and instruments have improved significantly** compared to 16 years ago.
    - Success rates for difficult filter retrievals are **higher now**.
- **Timing and urgency:**
  - IR explicitly states that **retrieval is not urgent**.
  - It **may be scheduled as an outpatient procedure** if and when the patient decides to proceed.
  - They encourage the primary team to **contact IR when the patient makes a decision**; for outpatient scheduling, they provide a contact number (4‑1022).
- **Impact on current plan:**
  - Previous 12/9 plan had tied **resumption of heparin drip** to **post‑IVC filter retrieval**.
  - The 12/10 IR note clarifies that retrieval will **not** be done emergently/inpatient unless the patient opts in; instead it becomes an **elective, patient‑driven outpatient consideration**.
  - As of 12/10, therefore:
    - **Heparin remains on hold**.
    - The plan to restart heparin “after IVC filter retrieval” now effectively depends on a future **outpatient decision** rather than a scheduled inpatient procedure.

Net: 12/10 adds the **patient‑centered IR conversation** that reframes IVC filter retrieval as **elective/outpatient**, while she remains off systemic anticoagulation due to her large hematoma, despite persistent high thrombotic risk.

---

### C.4 Infectious Disease, Antimicrobials, and COVID Status

- **Systemic antibiotics (as of 12/10):**
  - **Cefepime 2 g IV q8h** – **continued**.
  - **Daptomycin** – **stopped on 12/9 per ID**, remains discontinued.
  - **Metronidazole (Flagyl)** – **stopped on 12/9 per ID**, remains discontinued.
  - **Nystatin oral suspension** – continued for thrush prophylaxis/treatment.
- **Indications:**
  - Continued treatment of:
    - **Acute cholecystitis/choledocholithiasis** in a high‑risk surgical candidate (post‑ERCP with CBD stent).
    - Complex **line‑related infection history**, though current blood cultures are negative.
  - No evidence of active **Stenotrophomonas bacteremia** or **valvular endocarditis**:
    - Past Stenotrophomonas course completed 11/29.
    - Serial blood cultures **negative** (including 11/16, 11/22, 12/2).
    - TEE: no valvular vegetations.
- **Current infectious status:**
  - Patient is **afebrile**, **hemodynamically stable**, without new infectious complaints.
  - WBC on 12/10 is **11.08 K/µL** (mild leukocytosis), similar to prior mild elevations.
- **COVID‑19:**
  - COVID PCR positive 11/22–11/23.
  - Clinical course remains **mild**:
    - On **room air** with SpO₂ 99%.
    - No new pulmonary complaints documented.
  - No remdesivir or steroids have been used, consistent with:
    - Lack of hypoxia.
    - Concern about liver function earlier in the stay.

Net: By 12/10, antibiotic therapy is **simplified to cefepime plus nystatin**, with no signs of active systemic sepsis or endocarditis; COVID‑19 remains mild and clinically quiescent.

---

### C.5 Hepatobiliary Disease, DILI Resolution, UC/Short-Gut, and Nutrition

#### C.5.1 Liver Function and Biliary Disease

- **LFTs on 12/10 03:58:**
  - AST: **20 IU/L** (normal).
  - ALT: **67 IU/L** (mildly elevated but markedly improved from prior 700–850 range).
  - ALP: **114 IU/L** (near‑normal).
  - Total bilirubin: **0.5 mg/dL** (normal).
  - Direct bilirubin: **0.3 mg/dL**.
  - Albumin: **2.3 g/dL** (low).
  - Total protein: **4.6 g/dL** (low).
- Interpretation:
  - Transaminitis is **substantially improved**, now in a **mild residual elevation** range consistent with resolving **DILI** (attributed to minocycline ± other agents).
  - ALP and bilirubin are **normal or near‑normal**, which further supports **improvement** and argues against ongoing significant obstructive cholestasis.
  - Hypoalbuminemia persists, consistent with **chronic illness, TPN‑dependent short gut, and inflammation**.

- **Biliary disease status:**
  - No new biliary imaging or procedures on 12/10.
  - Prior findings stand:
    - s/p ERCP (11/19) with CBD stone sweep and **plastic CBD stent** in place (confirmed on prior CT).
    - HIDA (11/30) suspicious for **acute cholecystitis**.
    - General Surgery continues to **defer cholecystectomy**; outpatient evaluation when stable.
  - On exam 12/10:
    - Abdomen benign; **no RUQ tenderness** or new abdominal signs.

#### C.5.2 UC / Short-Gut Syndrome, TPN, and Fluids

- **Chronic GI background (unchanged):**
  - Ulcerative colitis s/p total proctocolectomy/ileostomy with multiple resections.
  - Short‑gut syndrome with **TPN dependence**, hypoalbuminemia, and multiple enterocutaneous fistulas.
  - On long‑term **teduglutide (Gattex)**.

- **TPN and lipids (12/10 med list):**
  - **TPN – Adult Special Formula**:
    - Total volume **1,600 mL/day** via central line.
    - Rate **67 mL/hr** (continuous).
  - **SMOFlipid 20% 40 g/day**:
    - 250 mL at **16.6 mL/hr**, continuous IV over 12 hours.
  - Orders show overlapping 24‑hour cycles (e.g., stop times 12/10 20:59 and 12/11 20:59), indicating ongoing treatment at **goal dose** (as recommended by Nutrition on 12/9).
- **Other continuous medications:**
  - **Lactated Ringers 1,000 mL at 80 mL/hr** (ongoing IV fluids).
  - **Losartan 25 mg daily** (continued cautiously).
  - **Loperamide** scheduled 4 mg q6h (ostomy output management).
  - **Gattex (patient’s own medication)** – continued subcutaneously.

- **Intake/output (24‑hour periods from 07:00):**
  - Table shows:
    - 12/8: Intake ~**3359.6 mL**, output **2600 mL**, net **+760 mL**.

### C.7 Overall Integrated Status as of 12/10/2025

By the end of 12/10, relative to the detailed picture through 12/9:

1. **Clinical stability and improvement:**
   - Patient remains **afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non‑hypoxic** on room air.
   - Right chest wall/axillary pain from the hematoma is **not worsening** and has **improved** with pressure dressings.
   - Neurologically, she is **intact and functional**, with no new stroke symptoms.

2. **Hematoma and bleeding:**
   - Large right subpectoral hematoma is still the main bleeding source but appears **contained**, with **no imaging evidence of active extravasation** and **no current signs of expansion**.
   - Hemoglobin is **stable around 8.1 g/dL** after transfusions; platelets have improved to **~119K**.

3. **Anticoagulation and thrombosis:**
   - Despite **high thrombotic risk** (acute LE and UE DVTs, SVC catheter‑associated thrombus, prior embolic strokes, complex IVC filter), **systemic anticoagulation (heparin drip, enoxaparin) remains on hold** due to bleeding risk from the hematoma.
   - Mechanical prophylaxis with **SCDs** continues.
   - The prior intention to resume heparin “after IVC filter retrieval” is now complicated by IR’s determination that retrieval is **non‑urgent and elective/outpatient**.

4. **IVC filter management:**
   - IR’s 12/10 bedside consultation reframes IVC filter retrieval as a **patient choice**, to be scheduled **outpatient** if desired.
   - Risks/benefits, including improved modern retrieval techniques, were explained in detail to the patient and her daughter.
   - No retrieval is performed during this inpatient stay as of 12/10.

5. **Infection and antibiotics:**
   - No evidence of active bacteremia or endocarditis; prior Stenotrophomonas and line infections appear fully treated.
   - Antibiotic regimen is **de‑escalated** to **cefepime alone** (plus nystatin), with **daptomycin and Flagyl discontinued**.
   - COVID‑19 remains **mild and clinically quiescent**.

6. **Liver and biliary status:**
   - LFTs show marked **continued improvement**, consistent with resolving **DILI** on a background of previous cholecystitis and ERCP with CBD stenting.
   - No new biliary interventions; cholecystectomy remains deferred.

7. **Nutrition and chronic GI issues:**
   - **TPN and SMOFlipid are running at goal**, with additional LR for hydration.
   - Short‑gut syndrome and UC‑related anatomy remain stable; ostomy output is non‑bloody and clinically manageable.
   - Hypoalbuminemia and mild electrolyte disturbances persist but are expected and monitored.

In sum, as of **12/10/2025**, the patient is **clinically stable with improving laboratory trends** (platelets, liver enzymes) and a **contained chest wall hematoma**, but remains in a **high‑risk tension zone** between bleeding risk (limiting anticoagulation) and significant underlying **thrombotic burden** (DVTs, SVC thrombus, prior embolic strokes, complex IVC filter).

## Appendix D – Additional Imaging and Cardiac/Diagnostic Studies (12/5–12/9/2025)

This appendix summarizes key findings from **radiology and cardiac tests performed between 12/5/2025 and 12/9/2025**, with emphasis on:

* Which specific studies were reviewed.
* Which results are **already incorporated** into the main body or earlier appendices.
* **New or clarifying details** that were *not* fully captured in the prior narrative.

### D.1 Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) – 12/5/2025

**Study:** TEE Complete, 12/5/2025 13:46 (Accession 12545791).

**Key report findings (direct from the TEE report):**

* **Global function and chamber sizes**
  * Normal left ventricular size and global systolic function.
  * **LVEF 60–65% by visual estimation.**
  * Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.

* **Valves**
  * Aortic valve: normal trileaflet morphology; **no aortic stenosis**; **trace aortic insufficiency**.
  * Mitral valve: structurally normal; **trace mitral regurgitation**.
  * Tricuspid valve: structurally normal; **trace tricuspid regurgitation**.
  * Pulmonic valve: normal; no vegetations; trace regurgitation at most.

* **Atria, septum, and thrombus/shunt evaluation**
  * Left atrium and **left atrial appendage (LAA) free of thrombus**.
  * Atrial septum structurally normal on 2D and color Doppler.
  * Agitated saline (bubble) study: **no bubbles in the left heart** → **no PFO or intracardiac right‑to‑left shunt detected.**

* **Aorta and pericardium**
  * **Small, simple plaque** in the descending aorta.
  * Aortic root diameter normal for body size.
  * **No pericardial effusion.**

* **Critical catheter finding**
  * 2D/3D imaging shows a **mobile echodensity on the tip of the SVC catheter**, measuring about **0.7 × 0.8 cm**, described as “**vegetation vs thrombus**.”
  * Report specifically recommends **clinical correlation and consideration of dedicated vascular imaging.**

**How this relates to the main report:**

* Section **9.1 (TEE – 12/5/2025)** already captures the *substance* of these findings:
  * Normal biventricular function and EF ~60–65%.
  * No atrial/LAA thrombus, no PFO/right‑to‑left shunt.
  * No left‑sided valvular vegetations/endocarditis.
  * Presence of a small mobile mass on the SVC catheter tip (thrombus vs vegetation).
* The original TEE report **fully supports and refines** that summary; there are **no discrepant or additional pathologic findings** beyond what is already described.

---

### D.2 Venous Duplex – Right Upper Extremity (R/O DVT) – 12/5/2025

**Study:** Venous Duplex – R/O DVT Right Upper Extremity, 12/5/2025 18:07.

**Key report findings:**

* **Technical quality:**
  * Study explicitly labeled **“technically difficult/limited”** due to patient positioning and bandaging.
  * **Proximal and mid right subclavian vein** segments are **non‑visualized**.

* **Visualized venous segments (all right‑sided):**
  * Innominate vein, internal jugular vein (prox/mid/distal), **distal subclavian**, axillary, brachial (prox/mid/distal), radial (prox/mid/distal), ulnar (prox/mid/distal), cephalic, and basilic veins.
  * All of these segments demonstrate **complete compressibility** and are interpreted as **“Normal (Patent)”**.

* **Impression (verbatim essence):**
  * “No obvious evidence of deep vein thrombosis in portions visualized.”
  * Because of the non‑visualized subclavian segments and limitations, **DVT cannot be fully excluded** in the non‑visualized proximal/mid subclavian region.

**Relation to the status report:**

* Section **9.2** already describes this study as **technically limited**, with **no DVT in the visualized segments**, and emphasizes that clot cannot be excluded in the non‑visualized subclavian/SVC territory.
* The full report reinforces that description; there is **no additional positive finding** (no confirmed right‑arm DVT).

### D.3 CT Venogram Chest with IV Contrast – 12/6/2025 (Reported 12/7)

**Study:** CT Venogram Chest with IV Contrast, 12/6/2025 15:44 (Accession 12554095).

**Key report findings:**

* **Lungs and pleura**
  * Lungs **clear**; **no effusion** and no pneumothorax.

* **Central veins and IVC filter**
  * **Right‑sided tunneled central venous catheter** with tip terminating in the **SVC**.
  * **“No CT evidence of sizable discernible catheter associated thrombus”** at the catheter tip.
  * **Tilted suprarenal IVC filter** with **multiple struts extending beyond the IVC lumen.**

* **Incidental vascular finding – *not previously called out in the status report***
  * A **6 mm calcified splenic artery aneurysm** is described (“calcified splenic artery aneurysm measuring 6 mm”).
  * This is a **small, calcified, incidental aneurysm** in the splenic artery; no associated acute complication is reported.

* **Upper abdomen**
  * **Diffuse hepatic steatosis**.

**How this relates to the main report:**

* Sections **9.3** and **A.3** already incorporate almost all of this CT venogram’s clinically relevant content:
  * Confirmation that the **SVC catheter tip appears free of sizable CT‑visible thrombus** (in contrast to the small mobile mass seen by TEE).
  * Documentation of the **tilted suprarenal IVC filter with struts extending beyond the IVC**, prompting IR/vascular surgery consideration.
  * Recognition of **diffuse hepatic steatosis** in the upper abdomen.
* **New detail added here:**
  * The **calcified 6 mm splenic artery aneurysm** was **not previously mentioned** in the status report.
    * It is a small, likely chronic, **incidental vascular finding**, without any reported rupture, ischemia, or direct link to current symptoms.
    * It does, however, mean she has at least one **documented splanchnic arterial aneurysm** on imaging, which may be worth awareness in long‑term vascular follow‑up even if not actionable acutely.

### D.4 Chest X‑rays (AP Portable) – 12/7/2025 and 12/8/2025

#### 12/7/2025 – Chest, AP Portable

* **Findings:**
  * Tunneled right IJ catheter tip in the SVC, stable.
  * No pulmonary vascular congestion.
  * **No focal consolidation; no effusion seen** (left costophrenic angle partially excluded).
  * No pneumothorax; mediastinum and bones without acute abnormality.
* **Impression:**
  * “No definitive focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia radiographically.”

This exactly matches the summary already provided in **§9.4** (12/7 CXR: no definite focal consolidation).

#### 12/8/2025 – Chest, AP Portable

* **Findings:**
  * Tunneled right IJ catheter tip over the **mid–distal SVC** (appropriately positioned).
  * **Blunting of the right costophrenic angle with adjacent hazy opacity**, read as **trace right pleural effusion with likely atelectasis.**
  * No pulmonary vascular congestion; no pneumothorax.
  * “Likely swollen right upper extremity,” though soft‑tissue assessment is limited on plain film.
* **Impression:**
  * Properly positioned tunneled catheter.
  * **Trace right pleural effusion with hazy opacity**—most consistent with atelectasis, with early infection not fully excludable.

This is already summarized in **§9.4**; the full report mainly adds the explicit
characterization of the catheter tip position (mid–distal SVC) and reiterates the suggestion of mild right‑sided soft‑tissue swelling.

---

### D.5 CT Chest with IV Contrast – 12/8/2025

**Study:** CT Chest with IV Contrast (“CT:Chest W/non‑ionic Contrast”), 12/8/2025 14:53 (Accession 12555699).

**Key report findings (brief recap):**

* **Large right subpectoral hematoma**
  * Approximate dimensions **7.7 × 7.6 × 5.1 cm** in the right subpectoral space, along the tunneled catheter course.
  * **Layering hyperdensity** consistent with blood products.
  * **No CT evidence of active contrast extravasation.**
  * **Right subclavian artery and vein appear patent.**

* **Pulmonary parenchyma**
  * **Patchy airspace opacities in the anterior portions of both upper lobes**, for which the radiologist explicitly says to **“correlate for pneumonia.”**
  * Basilar linear opacities interpreted as **atelectasis/scarring**.
  * No pleural effusion, pleural mass, or pneumothorax.

* **Upper abdomen**
  * **CBD stent** in place.
  * **Pneumobilia** (expected after sphincterotomy/stenting).
  * **Gallbladder sludge/stones** (high‑density material at the gallbladder base).
  * **IVC filter legs abutting the portal vein**, again emphasizing the malposition/extra‑caval extension of struts.

These elements have already been thoroughly incorporated in **Appendix A** and **§10.2** of the main report. The full radiology text largely confirms the previous synthesis; there are **no contradictory or additional major findings** beyond what is already summarized.

### D.6 Venous Duplex – Bilateral Lower Extremities (R/O DVT) – 12/9/2025

**Study:** Venous Duplex – R/O DVT Bilateral Lower Extremities, 12/9/2025 10:02.

**Key report findings:**

* **Right leg:**
  * External iliac, common femoral, deep femoral (proximal), femoral (prox/mid/distal), popliteal (prox/distal), gastrocnemius, posterior tibial, peroneal, and soleal veins are all **completely compressible and patent**, with impressions recorded as **“Normal (Patent)”**.
  * **Impression:** **No evidence of thrombus** in the right lower extremity.

* **Left leg:**
  * External iliac, common femoral, deep femoral, femoral (prox/mid/distal), popliteal (prox/distal), gastrocnemius, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins are **all patent and fully compressible**.
  * **Left soleal vein:** non‑compressible, with impression **“Acute thrombus”**.

* **Formal conclusion/impression:**
  * **Right:** no evidence of DVT or reflux.
  * **Left:** **acute thrombus confined to the soleal vein**; all other imaged deep veins are negative for DVT.

**Relation to the status report:**

* The main report already states that she has **acute DVTs involving the left subclavian vein and the left soleal vein**, and notes the absence of additional LE DVTs on subsequent imaging.
* This duplex provides **definitive confirmation that the lower‑extremity thrombus burden is limited to an isolated left soleal DVT**, with the **entire right leg and all other left‑leg deep veins patent**. That nuance (right leg fully clear on 12/9) is implicit in the narrative but is made explicit here.

### D.7 Recent EKG Interpretations (12/7 and 12/8, Interpreted 12/9)

There are **two EKG interpretation reports** dated 12/9/2025, corresponding to **tracings on 12/7 and 12/8**.

#### 12/7/2025 EKG (interpreted 12/9)

* **Rhythm:** Normal sinus rhythm.
* **Overall interpretation:** **Normal ECG.**
* **Comparison:**
  * When compared with the ECG from **11/24/2025 11:25**, the report notes:
    * “**Nonspecific T wave abnormality no longer evident in anterior leads.**”

#### 12/8/2025 EKG (interpreted 12/9)

* **Rhythm:** Normal sinus rhythm.
* **Overall interpretation:** **Normal ECG.**
* **Comparison:**
  * When compared with the ECG of **12/7/2025 18:26**, the report states:
    * **No significant change** was found.

**Relation to the status report:**

* The main report mentions EKG as part of the dyspnea work‑up but **does not explicitly document that the most recent ECGs are normal**.
* These two reports together show that:
  * Her **recent EKGs are normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes**, and
  * A previously described **nonspecific T‑wave abnormality in the anterior leads (11/24)** had **resolved by 12/7**, with **stable normal tracings by 12/8**.
* This provides **additional reassurance** regarding current cardiac electrical stability and supports the conclusion that her strokes are **embolic from venous/catheter sources**, rather than driven by an acute coronary/arrhythmic event evident on ECG.

---

### D.8 Overall Synthesis of New vs Confirmatory Information

Across these late‑hospitalization studies (12/5–12/9):

* Most imaging findings **validate and refine** what is already in the main status report:
  * TEE confirms **no intracardiac thrombus, no PFO/shunt, no valvular endocarditis**, and documents the **SVC catheter tip mass**.
  * CT venogram chest and CT chest both reinforce the picture of a **tilted suprarenal IVC filter with extra‑caval struts**, **hepatic steatosis**, and **no large CT‑visible catheter‑tip thrombus**, while CT chest additionally defines the **large right subpectoral hematoma** and **possible pneumonia‑like upper‑lobe opacities**.
  * CXR studies agree with the CT findings (no major consolidation, only trace effusion/atelectasis).
  * Venous duplex imaging shows that her **current lower‑extremity thrombus burden is confined to an acute left soleal DVT**, with the **right leg veins patent**.

* There are **two genuinely new or previously under‑emphasized points** that are now explicitly documented:
  1. **Small (≈6 mm) calcified splenic artery aneurysm** on CT venogram chest – an incidental, likely chronic vascular finding that was not mentioned earlier.
  2. **Latest EKGs (12/7 and 12/8)** show **normal sinus rhythm and normal ECGs**, with **resolution of prior nonspecific T‑wave abnormalities** in the anterior leads, providing additional reassurance against an acute coronary/arrhythmic driver of her recent events.

These additions slightly broaden the vascular and cardiac context, but they **do not materially alter** the primary narrative of her current hospitalization: a complex interplay of **short‑gut/TPN dependence, recurrent line infections, catheter/IVC‑filter–associated thrombosis, embolic cortical strokes, severe but improving thrombocytopenia and DILI, and a large right chest wall hematoma constraining anticoagulation.**
