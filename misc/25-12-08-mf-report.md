---

## 1. Chronic Conditions and Surgical History

### 1.1 Ulcerative Colitis and Abdominal Surgery

* Longstanding **ulcerative colitis**.
* Prior **total proctocolectomy with J‑pouch and end ileostomy** (remote).
* Major surgeries in **May–August 2019** (Colorectal Surgery, Dr. Smithy):

  * **05/05/2019:** Exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, reduction of closed‑loop obstruction/internal hernia, small‑bowel resection.
  * **05/13/2019:** Re‑laparotomy with **two additional small‑bowel resections**, creation of **end ileostomy** and **mucous fistula**.
  * **08/2019:** Incisional wound debridement and drainage; complicated by wound infection and subsequent development of multiple **enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs)** along prior midline incision.

**Resulting chronic issues:**

* **Short‑gut syndrome** with **functional short intestine**.
* **Chronic high‑output ileostomy**.
* Multiple **enterocutaneous fistulas** along prior midline incision.
* Frequent **SBO‑like episodes**, though imaging often shows chronic small‑bowel dilation rather than clear mechanical obstruction.
* Current abdominal findings:

  * **End ileostomy midline**, productive of liquid stool and gas.
  * Multiple ECFs, with intermittent bleeding from one superior fistula.

### 1.2 Short‑Gut Syndrome and Nutrition

* Functionally **short intestine** leading to chronic malabsorption.
* **TPN‑dependent**:

  * TPN **3 days/week**.
  * **2 L IV fluids** on non‑TPN days.
* Chronic use of **teduglutide (Gattex)** to augment intestinal absorption.
* Oral intake is limited; she can generally eat, but cannot meet caloric/protein needs enterally.

### 1.3 Central Venous Access, Line History, and IVC Filter

* **Long history of central venous catheters** for TPN:

  * Multiple tunneled lines (ports, Hickmans via LIJ and RIJ) since 2019.
* **3/2025:** Left IJ Hickman placed for TPN; complicated by **CLABSI** with:

  * **Caballeronia jiangsuensis** and **methicillin‑resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)**.
  * Treated with **meropenem + daptomycin for 2 weeks**.

#### IVC Filter

* **Suprarenal IVC filter** placed in **2009**.
* **Failed removal attempt**; earlier notes describe it as “dislodged IVC filter.”
* Imaging (e.g. **RUQ US 10/29/2025**, **CT A/P 10/26/2025** and subsequent scans):

  * Show persistent **suprarenal IVC filter**.
  * **Hyper‑echogenic/hyperdense material** in/around the filter consistent with thrombus or filter struts.
* Vascular surgery previously involved; outpatient follow‑up recommended.
* Later CT venogram (12/6) notes the filter is **tilted** with **multiple struts extending beyond the IVC** and suggests IR consult for retrieval if appropriate.

### 1.4 Other Chronic Conditions

* **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** – documented as non‑obstructive.
* **Hypertension**, usually treated with **losartan** (held at times for AKI or hyperkalemia).
* **Asthma** (no acute exacerbation in current records).
* **Obesity** historically; current BMI ~20.5 after chronic illness–related weight loss.
* History of:

  * **Frequent hospital admissions**.
  * **Falls**.
  * **Coagulopathy/anemia** (multifactorial: chronic disease, bleeding, etc.).

## 3. Current Admission (11/16/2025 – Present)

### 3.1 Reason for Admission and Initial Presentation

**Admitted 11/16/2025** with:

* **Chief complaints:**

  * Severe **nausea and vomiting**.
  * Inability to tolerate **oral Bactrim and minocycline**.
  * **Increased watery/foamy ileostomy output**.

**Context:**

* She was on **high‑dose Bactrim DS + minocycline** from the prior admission for Stenotrophomonas.
* Symptoms began soon after discharge:

  * Persistent, severe nausea.
  * Frequent vomiting and dry heaving.
  * Increased green, watery ostomy output, still with gas.
  * Fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, diaphoresis.
  * No high fevers or chills reported at admission.

**Initial labs 11/16:**

* WBC ~**11–12 K**.
* **AKI:** Creatinine **1.26** (baseline ~0.6), BUN **45**.
* **Hyponatremia:** Na **131**.
* **Lactic acidosis:** lactate **4.5 → 1.7** after fluids.
* Hgb **15.5** (hemoconcentrated).
* Platelets ~**250K**.

**Initial imaging (11/16):**

* **CT Abdomen/Pelvis (non‑contrast):**

  * Findings “concerning for **small bowel obstruction**” with suspected transition point at anterior central lower abdomen.
  * Persistent **CBD dilation** with ~1.0 cm density suggesting choledocholithiasis or biliary sludge.
  * Distended gallbladder with multiple stones and mild sludge; no definitive acute cholecystitis.
* **CT Chest (same date):**

  * Essentially mirrored abdominal CT impressions re SBO and biliary pathology.

### 3.2 Early Consults and Inpatient Management

**Infectious Disease consult (11/16):**

* Reviewed history of **line‑related Stenotrophomonas maltophilia** and recurrent line infections.
* Recognized **failure of PO Bactrim ± levofloxacin** due to severe GI intolerance.
* ID recommendations:

  * **Stop IV Bactrim** due to AKI.
  * Start **IV cefiderocol 1.5 g q8h** + **IV minocycline 200 mg q12h** for Stenotrophomonas.
  * Obtain CT A/P (done).
  * Send **GI PCR stool panel** (C. diff initially deferred).
  * Repeat **blood cultures** from line and periphery.

**Colorectal Surgery (CRS) consult (11/17 & 11/18):**

* Recognized her as a complex prior surgical patient with **chronically dilated small bowel**.
* Clinical exam:

  * Ileostomy with copious liquid stool and gas.
  * Soft, non‑distended abdomen, mild RLQ tenderness.
* Impression:

  * No clear **mechanical SBO** clinically; CT dilatation likely chronic.
  * Nausea more likely from **medications and/or biliary disease**.
* Recommendations:

  * No acute surgical intervention for bowel.
  * GI evaluation for suspected CBD stones and gallbladder disease.

**General Medicine management (11/16 onwards):**

* Volume resuscitation with **normal saline and lactated Ringer’s**.
* Held oral antimicrobials; followed ID’s IV cefiderocol + minocycline regimen.
* Work‑up for dyspnea (D‑dimer, CT chest, troponin, EKG) – no acute cardiopulmonary process.
* Plan to restart **TPN via right IJ Hickman**; nutrition consult initiated.

---

## 4. Biliary Disease, ERCP, and Liver Injury

### 4.1 Imaging and ERCP

**RUQ Ultrasound 11/17/2025:**

* **Choledocholithiasis/sludge** in a dilated CBD.
* **Cholelithiasis** with mild gallbladder wall thickening.
* No convincing acute cholecystitis.

**ERCP 11/19/2025:**

* **Duodenal sphincterotomy** performed.
* **Balloon sweep** of CBD stones/debris.
* **CBD stent** placed.

### 4.2 Liver Enzymes and DILI Evaluation

After ERCP and ongoing antibiotics, she developed **marked transaminitis**:

* AST up to ~**700 IU/L**, ALT up to ~**850 IU/L** in late November.
* ALP ~**200 IU/L**.
* Total bilirubin only mildly elevated (~**1.1–1.7 mg/dL**).

**HIDA scans:**

* **11/22 HIDA:**

  * No acute cholecystitis, no complete CBD obstruction.
* **11/30 HIDA:**

  * Nonvisualization of the gallbladder at 1 and 4 hours → concerning for **acute cholecystitis**.

**Antibiotic changes over this period:**

* Initially on **cefiderocol + minocycline**.
* As cholecystitis became more likely and Stenotrophomonas coverage remained relevant:

  * Started **meropenem**, later changed to **ertapenem (Invanz)** on **12/1** per ID/GI.

**GI assessment (12/2):**

* Noted LFT pattern now **primarily hepatocellular** (R‑factor ~8).
* ALP and bilirubin largely normalized or trending down.
* Concluded likely **drug‑induced liver injury (DILI)**, with:

  * **Minocycline** and possibly **levofloxacin** as primary culprits.
  * COVID‑19 infection and acute cholecystitis possible contributors.
* Autoimmune and viral serologies largely unremarkable.
* Ceruloplasmin low but not thought to be driving the acute picture.
* Plan:

  * Continue **ertapenem**.
  * Daily monitoring of LFTs, INR, metabolic panel.
  * No immediate further endoscopic intervention.

**LFT trend around 12/2:**

* As of **12/2:** ALT **732**, AST **356**, ALP **219**, total bilirubin **1.2** (all down from peak).

Later labs (12/3–12/5, from your TEE‑context summary):

* **12/3:** AST **221**, ALT **520**.
* **12/4:** AST **174**, ALT **440**.
* **12/5:** AST **119**, ALT **339**.
* ALP ~**195**, TBili ~**2.3**, DBili ~**0.8**.
* This reflects a **down‑trending** but still abnormal hepatic profile.

---

## 5. Thrombocytopenia, Venous Thromboses, and Anticoagulation

### 5.1 Platelet Trend and Thrombocytopenia

* On admission (11/16): Platelets **~250 K/µL**.
* **11/17:** 216 K.
* Over ~6–7 days, platelets fell to **~30–40 K/µL**.
* Peripheral smear:

  * **Giant thrombocytes**, macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, smudge cells.
  * **No schistocytes** (TTP less likely).

**Hematology consult (11/23):**

* Heparin‑induced thrombocytopenia (HIT/HITT) considered unlikely:

  * She had **refused prophylactic enoxaparin** earlier in the admission.
  * **HIT ELISA (PF4 IgG)** later negative (OD **0.052**).
* Thrombocytopenia assessed as:

  * Likely **cefiderocol‑induced**, a rare but documented adverse effect.
  * Some platelet recovery observed after discontinuing cefiderocol.
* Suggested work‑up included:

  * DIC labs (PT, PTT, fibrinogen).
  * **Antiphospholipid syndrome testing** (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, β2‑glycoprotein).

By early December:

* Platelets in the **40–50 K** range, later noted as around **70–74 K** (e.g., 12/5: Plt **74K**; 12/8: Plt **70K**).

### 5.2 Venous Thromboses and IVC Filter Thrombus

During this admission she developed **acute DVTs**:

* **Left subclavian vein** (via venous duplex).
* **Left soleal vein** (via lower extremity duplex).

Imaging (US/CT) comments also reiterate:

* **Suprarenal IVC filter** with echogenic/hyperdense material consistent with chronic thrombus or filter struts.
* Some notes have misreferenced this as “SVC thrombus,” but this was later clarified as **IVC + filter** (and separately, a potential SVC catheter mass).

### 5.3 Anticoagulation Strategy (Up to Early December)

Because of:

* Multiple new DVTs (arm + leg),
* Chronic IVC filter thrombus,
* High thrombotic risk profile,

she was started on **therapeutic heparin infusion**:

* Goal: keep PTT in therapeutic range (60–80 seconds at times).
* Hematology explicitly endorsed **full anticoagulation despite platelets <50 K**, given very high clot risk.
* This decision was complicated by:

  * Ongoing bleeding from ECF/ileostomy.
  * Platelets in the 30–50K range.
* Heparin infusions were sometimes held around bleeding episodes, then restarted.

---

## 6. COVID‑19 Infection

* **PCR positive 11/22/2025**.
* Symptoms:

  * Mild dyspnea on exertion.
  * Oxygen saturation 98–99% on room air.
* CXR: no acute infiltrates.
* No remdesivir or steroids were given:

  * She was not hypoxic.
  * Concern for liver injury.
* COVID considered a contributor to systemic inflammation and possibly liver injury.

---

## 7. Neurologic Events and Stroke (12/1–12/2)

### 7.1 Clinical Presentation (Code BAT 12/1)

Timeline (12/1):

* ~02:00:

  * Patient noticed her arms “not cooperating,” clumsiness, difficulty using phone and commode.
* Symptoms partially improved, then recurred.
* ~06:30:

  * Again noted difficulty using arms, especially right‑sided incoordination.
* ~09:30:

  * Nurse observed bilateral upper extremity ataxia and right arm drift → **Code BAT** at 09:35.

On stroke team arrival:

* **NIHSS = 3**, with:

  * Bilateral upper extremity (and right lower extremity) ataxia.
  * Right upper extremity upward drift.
* No aphasia or major sensory loss.

### 7.2 Neuroimaging

**CT Head (≈10:02 on 12/1):**

* Motion degraded.
* **No large acute intracranial hemorrhage**.

**CTA/CTP (initial and repeat):**

* First CTA/CTP: nondiagnostic due to motion.
* Repeat CTA/CTP:

  * **No large vessel occlusion**.
  * Neck and intracranial vessels deemed normal.
  * CT perfusion: no significant abnormality.

**MRI Brain DWI/FLAIR (12/1, reported 12/2):**

* **Acute infarcts** involving:

  * **Left posterior frontal lobe** within the **precentral gyrus** (motor area).
  * Smaller infarct in **right parietal lobe** within **postcentral gyrus** (sensory area).
  * Additional note of small medial right parietal involvement and partial extension into left parietal lobe.
* SWI: no hemorrhage seen.

**MRA Head:**

* No aneurysm, malformation, or large vessel pathology.

### 7.3 Neurologic Examination (12/2)

* Mental status:

  * Alert, oriented, fluent speech.
  * Mild difficulty with complex commands.
  * Subjective feeling: “right hand not cooperating,” but better than initially.
* Motor:

  * 5/5 strength in all extremities.
  * No drift on 12/2 exam (prior exam had subtle “parietal drift” in the right arm).
* Sensory:

  * Intact to light touch and pain.
  * Mild **right‑sided proprioceptive dysfunction**.
* Coordination:

  * Initially: bilateral UE/LE ataxia.
  * By 12/2: mostly resolved; only subtle deficits on finger‑to‑nose with eyes closed.

### 7.4 Neurology Assessment and Plan

* Infarcts characterized as **small–moderate cortical strokes**, likely **embolic**.
* Leading hypothesis:

  * **Paradoxical embolism or other embolic source**, given:

    * **Suprarenal IVC filter with thrombus**.
    * New DVTs (subclavian and soleal).
  * Patient had been on **therapeutic heparin drip since 11/27**, so strokes occurred **despite anticoagulation**.
* Less likely:

  * Atherosclerotic stroke (normal CTA/MRA, low LDL, minimal plaque).
* Not considered candidate for:

  * Thrombolysis (tPA/TNK):

    * Out of time window.
    * Platelets ~40–50 K.
    * On therapeutic heparin.
    * Active bleeding risk.
  * Antiplatelet therapy:

    * Contraindicated by thrombocytopenia and bleeding.
  * Statin:

    * Low yield (non‑atherosclerotic etiology).
    * Problematic given severe transaminitis.

**Neurology Plan:**

* Continue **therapeutic heparin infusion** as only viable stroke + VTE management given constraints.
* Neurologic checks every 4 hours (earlier q2h considered).
* Further work‑up:

  * **Transthoracic echo (TTE) with bubble**:

    * Later reported no PFO (no bubbles in left heart).
  * Subsequent **TEE** (see below).
  * Repeat CT head as needed if heparin fully therapeutic and/or clinical changes, to monitor for hemorrhagic transformation.
  * Ongoing search for infectious embolic sources (blood cultures, valve imaging).

By 12/5 Neurology progress note (via your summary):

* Exam markedly improved:

  * Full 5/5 strength, no drift, no ataxia on finger‑to‑nose or heel‑to‑shin.
  * Normal cranial nerves, sensation, language.
  * Functionally using phone, commode; working with PT/OT.

## 9. TEE, Venogram, and Subsequent Imaging (Early December)

### 9.1 TEE – 12/5/2025

**TEE (12/5/25, 13:46; interpreted by Dr. Tahmid Rahman):**

**Indications:** Evaluate for cardioembolic source and endocarditis in the setting of multifocal embolic strokes and a history of line infections.

**Key findings:**

* **Left/right ventricular function:**

  * Normal LV size and systolic function; **LVEF 60–65%** (visually).
  * Normal RV size and systolic function.

* **Left atrium / left atrial appendage:**

  * No clot in LA or LAA.
  * Normal LAA emptying velocity (~0.49 m/s).

* **Atrial septum / shunt:**

  * Atrial septum structurally normal and intact on 2D and color Doppler.
  * **Agitated saline bubble study:** no bubbles seen in the left heart.
  * Interpretation: **no PFO or intracardiac right‑to‑left shunt detected**.

* **Valves / vegetations:**

  * Aortic valve: normal trileaflet, no stenosis; **trace aortic insufficiency**.
  * Mitral valve: normal; **trace mitral regurgitation**.
  * Tricuspid valve: structurally normal; **no vegetations, trace TR**.
  * Pulmonic valve: normal; **no vegetations, trace PR**.
  * Overall: **No obvious evidence of valvular endocarditis**.

* **Pericardium / aorta:**

  * No pericardial effusion.
  * Aortic root and ascending aorta normal in size.
  * **Small, simple, immobile plaque** in the descending aorta.

* **Critical finding: SVC catheter‑associated mass:**

  * **Small mobile echodensity** in the SVC, measuring **0.7 x 0.8 cm**.
  * Appears **adherent to the tip of the SVC catheter** (right IJ tunneled line).
  * Differential: **catheter‑related thrombus vs catheter‑associated vegetation**.
  * Recommendation: **consider dedicated vascular imaging** for further evaluation.

**TEE overall interpretation:**

* **Rules against:**

  * Left‑sided valvular endocarditis as the stroke source.
  * Left atrial/left atrial appendage thrombus.
  * PFO or intracardiac shunt as a mechanism for paradoxical emboli.
* **Supports:**

  * Presence of a **mobile mass on the SVC catheter tip**, consistent with **catheter‑associated thrombus vs vegetation** in the SVC.

### 9.2 Venous Duplex – Right Upper Extremity (12/5, reported 12/6)

**Study:** “VENOUS R/O DVT RIGHT UPPER” – right arm venous duplex.

**Findings:**

* **Normal/patent**:

  * Internal jugular (proximal, mid, distal), distal subclavian vein (visualized portion), axillary, brachial, ulnar, radial, cephalic, and basilic veins.
* **Non‑visualized**:

  * **Proximal and mid right subclavian vein** not adequately seen.
* Overall impression:

  * **Technically limited** study.
  * No DVT in visualized segments.
  * Cannot exclude clot in **non‑visualized proximal/mid subclavian or SVC**.

### 9.3 CT Venogram Chest with IV Contrast (12/6, reported 12/7)

**CT venogram chest (12/6):**

* **Lungs/pleura:**

  * Clear; no effusion or pneumothorax.
* **Vessels:**

  * Thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery appear normal.
  * Right‑sided **tunneled central venous catheter** with tip in the SVC.
  * Reported: **“No CT evidence of sizable discernible catheter‑associated thrombus”** at the catheter tip.
  * IVC filter:

    * **Tilted**, with multiple struts **extending beyond the IVC**.
    * Recommendation to **consider IR evaluation** for potential retrieval.
* **Heart/mediastinum/axillae/bones:**

  * No significant abnormality.
* **Upper abdomen:**

  * **Diffuse hepatic steatosis**.

**Interpretation vs TEE:**

* TEE showed a **0.7 x 0.8 cm mobile echodensity** on the catheter tip in SVC.
* CT venogram did not demonstrate a **sizable** thrombus but does not exclude smaller or more subtle mobile clot.
* Clinically, team continues to treat as **catheter‑associated SVC thrombus** based on TEE.

### 9.4 Chest X‑rays (12/7 and 12/8)

**12/7 Portable AP Chest X‑ray:**

* Indication: evaluate for pneumonia.
* Findings:

  * Right IJ tunneled central venous catheter tip in SVC, stable.
  * No pulmonary vascular congestion.
  * **No focal consolidation**.
  * No obvious pleural effusion or pneumothorax (left costophrenic angle not fully seen).
  * Heart and mediastinum stable.
* Impression:

## 10. Events on 12/7–12/8/2025: Bleeding, Hematoma, and Heparin/TPN Hold

### 10.1 Bleeding / Anemia Around 12/7

From 12/7 General Medicine note:

* Overnight concern for **bleeding from the ostomy site**.
* Around 4 AM on 12/7:

  * Hemoglobin dropped to **6.9 g/dL**.
* She received **1 unit PRBC**; later Hgb improved to **7.7 g/dL**.
* Plan documented:

  * **Continue full‑dose heparin** at that time.
  * Transfuse if **Hgb <7**.
  * Continue to monitor hemoglobin/hematocrit.

### 10.2 Right Axillary Pain and Suspected Chest Wall Hematoma (12/8)

From 12/8 General Medicine progress note:

* On morning rounds 12/8:

  * Patient reports **significant pain just proximal to the right axilla**, near the tunneled catheter.
  * Exam:

    * Area **“seems full”**.
    * Point tenderness over the region.
    * Limited right arm range of motion due to pain.
    * Radial, ulnar, and brachial pulses present.
* The note states:

  * **“Concern for bleeding under ultrasound”**:

    * Indicates that ultrasound imaging of the region raised suspicion for a **bleed/hematoma**.
    * Formal ultrasound report is not included in the note, but clinical impression is that of a **chest wall/axillary hematoma** near the catheter.
  * Case was discussed with **Interventional Radiology (IR)**.
* As a result:

  * **Heparin drip (therapeutic heparin gtt) was suspended**.
  * **TPN was suspended**.
* Plan:

  * Order **CT chest with IV contrast**:

    * Specifically “for evaluation of **right sided chest wall hematoma**.”
  * Check repeat Hgb/Hct:

    * At time of note, hemoglobin and hematocrit were **stable**.
    * Labs around 6:00 on 12/8:

      * Hgb **9.4 g/dL**.
      * Hct **27.3%**.
      * Platelets **70 K/µL**.
      * WBC **10.24 K/µL**.
      * Na **136**, K **4.5**, Cr **0.47**, BUN **11**.
      * ALT **135**, AST **32**, Alk Phos **153**.
      * Albumin **2.4**, total protein **4.7**.

**Medications and infusions on 12/8:**

  * **Lovenox** already suspended (if previously ordered).
  * **TPN** clinically held (though an order exists set to stop 12/9, plan is to suspend it).

**Intake/Output as of 12/8 (from nutrition note and progress note):**

* For a partial 24‑hour period on 12/8:

  * Intake **91–235 mL** (two notes give different snapshots).
  * Output **550 mL**.
  * Net negative ~**–315 to –459 mL**.

## 11. Nutrition Status as of 12/8/2025

From 12/8 Nutrition note:

* **TPN and IV lipids**:

  * Were running at **goal rate** previously.
  * **Held on the morning of 12/8** due to **possible central line problem (arm/chest wall pain near line)**.
* Dietitian’s recommendations:

  * If TPN must remain off:

    * Provide **IV dextrose via peripheral IV** to supply calories (glucose) in the interim.
  * Once safe:

    * **Resume full‑dose TPN** at:

      * **67 mL/hr over ~24 hours** for the TPN solution.
      * **SMOFlipid** at **16.6 mL/hr over 12 hours**.
    * This regimen provides approximately:

      * **1,387 kcal/day**.
      * **70 g protein/day**.
      * **40 g fat/day**.
  * Continue **Ensure Clear TID** and **regular/unrestricted diet** as tolerated by the patient.

**Oral intake and weight:**

* Patient reports **very poor appetite** in hospital:

  * Typically **about one meal per day**, often just a few bites.
  * Even when family brings preferred foods (e.g., ice cream sundae), intake is minimal.
* Weight:

  * Last recorded weight on **12/1**: **59.4 kg** (130.7 lb).
  * Down from **66.7 kg (≈147 lb)** in late October.
  * Nutrition requests **updated measured weight**.

## 12. Consolidated Current Status as of 12/8/2025

### 12.1 Active Major Problems

1. **Short‑gut syndrome, TPN‑dependent**, post multiple bowel resections, with:

   * End ileostomy, mucous fistula, and multiple ECFs.
   * Chronic high‑output ostomy and ECFs; intermittent bleeding from fistulas (one cauterized 12/2).

2. **Recurrent, complex line‑associated infections and thromboses**, currently with:

   * Right IJ **tunneled catheter** (placed 11/11/25) in SVC.
   * **TEE (12/5)** showing a **0.7 x 0.8 cm mobile echodensity on SVC catheter tip** (thrombus vs vegetation).
   * **CT venogram (12/6)** showing no large catheter‑tip thrombus but tilted IVC filter with protruding struts.
   * Multiple prior CLABSIs (Staph hominis, Stenotrophomonas, Caballeronia jiangsuensis, MRSE).
   * Recurrent antibiotic courses including cefiderocol, minocycline, meropenem, ertapenem, cefepime, daptomycin, metronidazole, Bactrim, and levofloxacin.

3. **Venous thromboembolism and filter thrombus**:

   * Acute **left subclavian** and **left soleal** DVTs.
   * Chronic **suprarenal IVC filter** with associated thrombus/tilted struts.
   * Now **SVC catheter‑associated thrombus** on TEE.

4. **Acute embolic strokes (12/1)**:

   * MRI: acute infarcts in **left precentral gyrus** and **right postcentral gyrus**, with some additional parietal involvement.
   * CTA/MRA: no large vessel occlusion; neck and intracranial arteries normal.
   * Clinically:

     * Initial bilateral UE ataxia and right arm drift.
     * By 12/5, neurologic exam essentially normalized; PT/OT ongoing.

5. **Severe thrombocytopenia**:

   * Platelets dropped from ~250K at admission to ~30–40K within a week.
   * Likely **cefiderocol‑associated**, with some recovery after the drug was discontinued.
   * HIT ruled out (no heparin initially, PF4 IgG negative).
   * Platelets ~70–74K by 12/5–12/8.

6. **Bleeding and anemia**:

   * Recurrent bleeding from **ECF/ostomy region**, with Hgb nadirs:

     * ~**6.3 g/dL** (earlier severe anemia event).
     * **6.9 g/dL** on 12/7, requiring transfusion.
   * As of 12/8:

     * Hgb **9.4 g/dL** after transfusions.
   * New suspected bleed:

     * **Right axillary/chest wall hematoma** near the tunneled catheter, with pain and fullness.
     * Ultrasound at bedside suggested bleeding.
     * CT chest with contrast ordered for hematoma evaluation.
   * Response:

     * **Heparin drip and TPN suspended** on 12/8 pending further imaging and stability assessment.

7. **Acute cholecystitis / choledocholithiasis**:

   * ERCP (11/19) with sphincterotomy, CBD sweep, and stent placement.
   * HIDA (11/30) consistent with acute cholecystitis.
   * US: hydronephrotic gallbladder with multiple stones, CBD dilation.
   * Considered a high‑risk surgical candidate; cholecystectomy deferred.
   * Managed medically with antibiotics (cefepime, daptomycin, metronidazole; previously ertapenem, meropenem).

8. **Severe transaminitis and DILI**:

   * AST up to ~700, ALT up to ~850 in late November, with mild ALP/bili elevation.
   * GI, ID, and Medicine concur that **minocycline (and possibly levofloxacin)** are likely causes, with COVID‑19 and cholecystitis as contributors.
   * After stopping minocycline:

     * AST/ALT down‑trending but still elevated as of 12/8 (AST 32, ALT 135; Alk Phos 153; albumin 2.4).

9. **COVID‑19 infection**:

   * PCR positive 11/22.
   * Mild clinical course, no hypoxia.
   * No COVID‑directed antivirals or steroids given.

### 12.2 Current Treatments and Holds (as of 12/8)

* **Antimicrobials:**

  * **Cefepime** IV, **daptomycin** IV, **metronidazole (Flagyl)** IV, **nystatin** oral.
  * Prior Invanz (ertapenem) stopped 12/3.

* **Anticoagulation:**

  * **Heparin IV infusion** was being used at therapeutic dose for DVT and stroke prevention, but:

    * As of **12/8**, **heparin drip is suspended** because of suspected chest wall/axillary hematoma near the tunneled catheter.

* **Fluids and nutrition:**

  * **Lactated Ringers** at 80 mL/hr.
  * **SMOFlipid** running.
  * **TPN:** ordered but **clinically held** as of 12/8 due to line/hematoma concerns.
  * Plan to use **peripheral IV dextrose** if TPN remains off, and to resume full TPN/SMOF once it is safe.

* **GI/ostomy management:**

  * Ongoing local care for ileostomy and ECFs.
  * Silver nitrate cauterization of a bleeding fistula (12/2).

* **Rehabilitation:**

  * **PT/OT** for stroke recovery and general deconditioning.

### 12.3 Hemodynamic and Laboratory Snapshot (12/8)

* Vitals (11:49 12/8):

  * T **36.7°C**, RR **17**, SpO₂ **99%** on room air.
